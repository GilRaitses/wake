# Geological Controls on Pacific Northwest Terroir and Cultural Landscape

Pleistocene glaciation and Holocene volcanic activity established the environmental parameters for food production systems, settlement patterns, and material culture across the Pacific Northwest bioregion. Archaeological evidence indicates continuous human occupation responding to these environmental conditions for over 10,000 years. Contemporary cultural production maintains these place-based relationships while integrating global markets and contemporary materials.

The route described traces these geological-cultural relationships across elevation gradients from 175 feet (Seattle) to 5,021 feet (McCall), spanning continental, maritime, and volcanic terranes.

---

## Environmental Controls on Regional Systems

### Glacial Controls on Soil Chemistry and Wine Terroir

Walla Walla Valley viticulture depends on glacial deposits from catastrophic floods. Glacial Lake Missoula outburst floods occurred 15,000-13,000 years ago, carrying mineral-rich sediment from Montana and depositing it throughout eastern Washington and Oregon. These flood deposits, combined with glacial till ground from granite mountains, created soils with exceptional mineral diversity and drainage characteristics.

Soil composition stresses grapevines sufficiently to concentrate flavors while providing mineral foundation for Pacific Northwest wine characteristics. Regional Rieslings reflect glacial granite mineral content, while terroir reflects catastrophic flood landscape formation.

### Glacial River Systems and Fish Habitat

Pacific Northwest salmon and trout populations depend on glacial processes that created optimal fish habitat. Glacial carving created deep, cold pools required for salmon spawning, while glacial sediment provides gravel beds essential for egg incubation. The Columbia River system, carved and repeatedly scoured by glacial floods, became North America's most productive salmon river.

Glacial grinding released minerals from bedrock into watersheds. Calcium from limestone, phosphorus from granite, and trace elements from volcanic rock support aquatic food webs sustaining wild fish populations.

### Volcanic Controls on Cheese Production

Mount Adams volcanic activity created lava tube caves where Cascadia Creamery ages artisan cheeses. These caves maintain 55°F year-round with optimal humidity while volcanic rock provides calcium carbonate and trace minerals. Regional cheeses carry volcanic terroir mineral signature—calcium from volcanic ash, trace elements from basalt, and flavor profiles from aging in North America's only volcanic cave cheese operation.

### Glacial Valley Agriculture and Geothermal Systems

Fertile valleys throughout the route exist because glacial processes created optimal agricultural conditions. Glacial valleys provide natural drainage, glacial till provides mineral-rich soil, and glacial landforms create microclimates necessary for diverse agriculture.

Hot springs represent deep geological connections where glacial carving exposed deep crustal fractures, allowing superheated groundwater to reach the surface. Hot spring mineral content—sulfur, calcium, magnesium, trace elements—represents deep earth chemistry that also enriches local soils and water systems.

### Contemporary Cultural Production

Contemporary arts, hospitality, and maker culture represent different approaches to interpreting and living within these geological conditions. Tyler Hays's work in Lostine demonstrates how understanding regional materials and processes informs contemporary design. His transformation of Pacific Northwest timber traditions into international luxury markets reflects engagement with local ecological relationships.

Luxury hospitality sectors, including Under Canvas glamping operations, represent evolution of human relationship to landscape that builds on indigenous seasonal camping patterns while incorporating contemporary materials and comfort standards. These cultural expressions complement scientific observation and indigenous knowledge systems in understanding place-based relationships.

## Pacific Northwest Culinary Heritage: Smokehouse Culture, Artisan Bakeries & Fire-Roasted Traditions

### Geological Foundations of Regional Food Culture

The geological processes that shaped this landscape also created ideal conditions for diverse food production. Glacial valleys provide perfect growing conditions for wheat and grains, volcanic soils enrich flavor profiles, and natural mineral springs create optimal conditions for artisan food production.

Regional food culture spans from indigenous fire-cooking traditions to European immigrant bakery techniques, creating a unique Pacific Northwest culinary landscape that honors both geological and cultural heritage.

**Regional Adaptations:**
- **Montana ranch lamb** - Grass-fed animals from Big Sky country
- **Oregon heritage breeds** - Katahdin and Dorper sheep
- **Washington wine country** - Lamb paired with local Syrah and Malbec
- **Idaho mountain cooking** - High-altitude fire-roasting techniques

**Perfect Patagonian-Style Experience:**
- **Open fire cooking** - Using native Pacific Northwest hardwoods
- **Traditional chimichurri** - Made with regional herbs and oils
- **Family-style serving** - Carved tableside from the cross
- **Local wine pairings** - Bold reds from Columbia Valley

**Where to Experience Cross-Roasted Lamb:**
- **Ranch experiences** - Working cattle and sheep ranches
- **Wine country dinners** - Special events at vineyards
- **Mountain lodge events** - Seasonal lamb roasts at luxury lodges
- **Chef collaborations** - Argentine chefs working with local ranchers

### **The Revolutionary Geological Discovery: Bretz's Two Flood Stories**

**This Missoula-Spokane route follows one of geology's most controversial and revolutionary discoveries. Recent research reveals that J Harlen Bretz actually proposed two different flood theories:**

**1. The Original "Spokane Flood" (1922-1927):**
- **Age:** 150,000 to possibly 1 million years ago
- **Source:** Canadian trench systems (Rocky Mountain trench, Purcell trench)
- **Mechanism:** Subglacial flow under the "Spokane Ice Sheet"
- **Water Path:** Down from Canadian trenches, under ice, carving major channels
- **Evidence:** Paleomagnetic dating shows reversed polarity (older than 780,000 years)
- **Impact:** Carved Grand Coulee, Moses Coulee, and major scabland channels

**2. The Later "Missoula Floods" (1927 onward):**
- **Age:** 19,000-15,000 years ago
- **Source:** Glacial Lake Missoula ice dam collapse (Joseph Pardee's contribution)
- **Mechanism:** Proglacial flooding (out in front of ice sheet)
- **Water Path:** From Missoula lake through already-carved channels
- **Evidence:** Well-dated sediment layers, rhythmites, current ripples
- **Impact:** Added decorative sediment layers to already-carved landscape

**Evidence from the Astoria Fan (offshore Oregon):**
- **1/3 of sediment:** From Missoula floods
- **2/3 of sediment:** From older Spokane floods
- **Implication:** The older floods were twice as massive as all Missoula floods combined

**The Scientific Partnership:**
- **J Harlen Bretz:** Mapped the effects (scabland channels, flood evidence)
- **Joseph Thomas Pardee:** Identified the cause (glacial Lake Missoula)
- **1925 Letter:** Pardee's crucial suggestion connected 500 cubic miles of lake water to Bretz's flood evidence
- **Geographic Connection:** Missoula (Pardee's study area) to Spokane (Bretz's field site)
- **Together:** They solved North America's greatest geological mystery

**The Two Geological Giants:**
- **Pardee (1871-1960):** USGS geologist, worked western Montana, first to map glacial Lake Missoula
- **Bretz (1882-1981):** University of Chicago professor, mapped channeled scablands, revolutionary catastrophist
- **Professional Relationship:** Cordial scientific correspondence led to breakthrough understanding
- **Legacy:** Their collaboration changed geology from gradualism to accepting catastrophic events

This route follows the path of both flood stories - the ancient Canadian drainage system that carved the major landscape features over hundreds of thousands of years, and the more recent Missoula flood deposits that left the detailed sediment layers visible today.

### **Specific Evidence Visible Along This Route:**

**Large Current Ripples on Glacial Lake Missoula Floor:**
- **Location:** Missoula valley floor (look for wave-like patterns)
- **Scale:** Ripples 20+ feet tall, spaced 300+ feet apart
- **Evidence:** Created by massive drainage events
- **Photography tip:** Best seen from elevated viewpoints around Missoula

**Glacial Lake Missoula Shoreline Terraces:**
- **Location:** Hillsides around Missoula (look for step-like formations)
- **Evidence:** Multiple lake levels from repeated dam breaks
- **What to look for:** Horizontal lines at consistent elevations
- **Significance:** Each terrace = one complete lake cycle

**Large Glacial Erratics:**
- **Location:** Throughout the route (out-of-place boulders)
- **Origin:** Canadian Rockies granite in wrong geology
- **Transport:** Carried by icebergs floating in flood waters
- **Evidence:** Boulders up to 40 feet in diameter deposited on hillsides

**Paleomagnetic Evidence Sites:**
- **Location:** Morango area (eastern Washington)
- **Evidence:** Flood layers with reversed magnetic polarity
- **Dating:** Older than 780,000 years (last magnetic flip)
- **Significance:** Proves multiple flood generations

**Rhythmite Layers:**
- **Location:** Road cuts along your route
- **Pattern:** Alternating coarse gravel and fine silt
- **Evidence:** Each layer = one flood cycle
- **Count:** 40+ separate flood events over 2,000 years

**The Astoria Fan Connection:**
All the eroded rock from these floods had to go somewhere - it created a large underwater fan offshore Oregon. Recent drilling reveals that 2/3 of this sediment pile comes from the older Spokane floods, with only 1/3 from the well-known Missoula floods.

First Grader Fascinated By Floods Story
Max Vuletich, a first grader at Jefferson Elementary in Spokane, Washington, prepared a display and shared the Floods story to many attendees at a STEM Event in March 2024.
Max became interested in the Great Missoula Floods when he saw a Public Television video in Kindergarten. He went to a Library and began reading about The Floods and googling topics. His mother, Mariah, reported that he loves the Floods story and continues to be passionate about learning all he can.

Perhaps he is destined to be a geologist!

# Geological Field Guide & Learning Journey

## Understanding Your Route Through Deep Time

This journey traces one of Earth's most dramatic geological stories - the catastrophic drainage of Glacial Lake Missoula and the subsequent Ice Age Floods that reshaped the Pacific Northwest. As you travel, you're following the exact path of these ancient floods, observing landscapes carved by forces almost beyond comprehension.

---

### Geological Pattern Recognition Guide: Reading Ancient Catastrophes in Stone

**🔍 How to Identify Ancient Flood Patterns vs. Normal River Erosion:**

The landscape you'll traverse tells the story of the most catastrophic floods in Earth's recent history. Learn to read these ancient patterns like a geological detective!

---

### **🌊 Catastrophic Flood Signatures (What Makes Missoula Floods Unique):**

**Giant Current Ripples (Washington & Oregon):**
- **What to Look For**: Massive "sand dune" patterns 30-50 feet tall
- **How to Identify**: Too large for normal rivers - only possible with 400-foot-deep flood water
- **Where You'll See Them**: Eastern Washington scablands, Columbia River valley
- **The Story**: Water moving 60+ mph created these giant underwater dunes

**Rhythmic Bedding Patterns (Montana):**
- **What to Look For**: Alternating layers of coarse gravel and fine silt
- **How to Identify**: Each layer = one flood cycle (40+ floods over 2,000 years!)
- **Where You'll See Them**: Road cuts near Missoula, valley walls
- **The Story**: Ice dam breaks → massive flood → dam rebuilds → repeat

**Scour Patterns & Streamlined Hills:**
- **What to Look For**: Teardrop-shaped hills with smooth, carved upstream faces
- **How to Identify**: All oriented same direction (toward Pacific Ocean)
- **Where You'll See Them**: Throughout Eastern Washington
- **The Story**: 400-foot-deep flood water carved these like a sculptor

---

### **🏔️ Glacial vs. Flood Patterns (Learn the Difference):**

**U-Shaped vs. V-Shaped Valleys:**
- **Glacial (U-shaped)**: Wide, rounded valley floors with steep sides
- **River (V-shaped)**: Narrow, pointed valley bottoms
- **Flood-carved**: Flat-bottomed with vertical walls (most dramatic!)
- **Your Route**: See all three types - compare as you drive!

**Erratics vs. Flood Boulders:**
- **Glacial Erratics**: Angular granite boulders in wrong rock type areas
- **Flood Boulders**: Rounded, sorted by size, in flood direction patterns
- **How to Tell**: Flood boulders form lines pointing toward Pacific

---

### **🎯 Location-Specific Pattern Hunting:**

**Montana Locations (Bozeman to Missoula):**
- **Look For**: Lake terraces on hillsides - ancient Glacial Lake Missoula shorelines
- **Pattern**: Step-like formations at consistent elevations
- **Story**: Each terrace = different lake level during ice dam cycles
- **Best Views**: Highway 90 between Bozeman and Missoula

**Idaho Corridor (Lochsa River Valley):**
- **Look For**: Perfectly straight valley walls and flat valley floor
- **Pattern**: Too straight and wide for normal glacial carving
- **Story**: Massive flood water carved this evacuation route in days
- **Best Views**: Highway 12 - entire route is a flood channel!

**Washington Scablands:**
- **Look For**: Bare basalt with no soil, bizarre landscape
- **Pattern**: Entire landscape stripped to bedrock
- **Story**: 400-foot-deep flood water scoured away millions of years of soil
- **Best Views**: I-90 east of Seattle - moonscape appearance

**Columbia River Gorge:**
- **Look For**: Vertical basalt walls with horizontal flood terraces
- **Pattern**: Stair-step terraces 300+ feet above current river
- **Story**: Each terrace = different flood level as ice dam burst
- **Best Views**: Multnomah Falls area - waterfalls follow flood-carved fractures

---

### **🔬 Detective Skills: Reading the Landscape Story**

**Size Sorting Patterns:**
- **Normal Rivers**: Gradual size changes from mountains to ocean
- **Flood Patterns**: Massive boulders next to fine silts (no gradual transition)
- **What This Means**: Only catastrophic forces can mix such different sizes

**Orientation Analysis:**
- **All Flood Features Point**: Southwest toward Pacific Ocean
- **Why This Matters**: Proves single, massive water source (Glacial Lake Missoula)
- **Your Challenge**: Notice how EVERYTHING aligns with flood direction

**Elevation Puzzles:**
- **Normal Rivers**: Flow downhill in predictable patterns
- **Flood Evidence**: Gravel deposits 1,000+ feet above current rivers
- **Mind-Blowing Fact**: Some flood evidence sits higher than modern valley rims!

---

### **📸 Pattern Photography Guide**

**Document These Patterns:**
1. **Layered Road Cuts**: Show rhythmic flood cycles
2. **Giant Ripples**: Photograph with people for scale
3. **Streamlined Hills**: Capture the teardrop shapes
4. **Flood Terraces**: Show multiple levels on valley walls
5. **Erratic Fields**: Boulder gardens in wrong locations

**Pro Tips:**
- Photograph from different angles to show 3D patterns
- Include scale objects (people, cars, trees)
- Early morning/late afternoon light reveals subtle patterns
- Look for patterns that seem "too big" for normal processes

---

### **🏞️ Ancient River Systems in the Rock Record: Reading Pre-Flood Landscapes**

**🔍 How to Identify Ancient River Channels vs. Modern Ones:**

Your route reveals a dramatic geological story: millions of years of normal river evolution suddenly interrupted by catastrophic floods! Learn to read both stories in the landscape.

---

### **📖 Reading Ancient River Signatures in Stone:**

**Channel Architecture Patterns:**
- **What to Look For**: Curved, meandering patterns preserved in rock layers
- **How to Identify**: S-shaped curves, point bars, oxbow lake scars
- **Where You'll See Them**: Road cuts showing layered sediments
- **The Story**: Rivers that flowed for millions of years before the floods

**Grain Size Sequences (Fining Upward):**
- **What to Look For**: Coarse gravel at bottom → fine sand at top in each layer
- **How to Identify**: Repeated sequences showing multiple river cycles
- **Where You'll See Them**: Exposed valley walls, especially in Montana
- **The Story**: Each sequence = one river's natural flood-to-low-water cycle

**Cross-Bedding Patterns:**
- **What to Look For**: Diagonal lines within rock layers (like frozen sand dunes)
- **How to Identify**: Slanted layers showing ancient water flow direction
- **Where You'll See Them**: Sandstone exposures along your route
- **The Story**: Ancient river currents preserved as stone "fingerprints"

---

### **🌊 Ancient Rivers vs. Catastrophic Flood Evidence:**

**Normal River Patterns (Pre-Flood):**
- **Channel Shape**: Gradual, meandering curves following topography
- **Sediment Size**: Gradually decreasing from mountains to sea
- **Time Scale**: Millions of years of slow, steady erosion
- **Evidence**: Smooth, rounded pebbles in organized layers

**Catastrophic Flood Disruption:**
- **Channel Shape**: Straight, bulldozed paths ignoring topography
- **Sediment Size**: Chaotic mixing of huge boulders with fine silt
- **Time Scale**: Landscape reshaped in days or weeks
- **Evidence**: Angular chunks, size-sorted flood bars, scour marks

---

### **🎯 Location-Specific Ancient River Hunting:**

**Montana (Bozeman to Missoula):**
- **Ancient River System**: Pre-flood Clark Fork and Missouri headwaters
- **What to Look For**: Gentle, curved valley patterns underneath flood terraces
- **Rock Record**: Tertiary sediments showing millions of years of normal erosion
- **Best Evidence**: Valley shapes that predate the dramatic flood modifications
- **Story**: These rivers carved landscapes for 50+ million years before floods

**Idaho (Lochsa River Corridor):**
- **Ancient River System**: Pre-glacial Clearwater drainage
- **What to Look For**: Buried river gravels beneath glacial deposits
- **Rock Record**: Ancient river terraces high above current valley floor
- **Best Evidence**: Highway 12 road cuts showing layered river deposits
- **Story**: Normal mountain river suddenly captured by glacial floodwaters

**Washington Channeled Scablands:**
- **Ancient River System**: Pre-flood Columbia tributaries and Palouse River
- **What to Look For**: Buried river channels beneath flood deposits
- **Rock Record**: Ancient river gravels preserved under basalt flows
- **Best Evidence**: Palouse Falls - ancient waterfall on pre-flood river
- **Story**: Gentle rivers obliterated by 400-foot-deep flood torrents

**Columbia River Gorge:**
- **Ancient River System**: Ancestral Columbia cutting through Cascade uplift
- **What to Look For**: Ancient river terraces at multiple elevations
- **Rock Record**: Gravel deposits showing river's gradual downcutting
- **Best Evidence**: Multiple terrace levels showing millions of years of cutting
- **Story**: Ancient Columbia's slow work accelerated by flood scouring

---

### **🔬 Advanced River Pattern Analysis:**

**Paleocurrent Analysis (Reading Flow Direction):**
- **Cross-Bedding Angles**: Show which way ancient rivers flowed
- **Imbricated Clasts**: Overlapping rocks point upstream
- **Channel Orientation**: Curved patterns show river meanders
- **Your Challenge**: Compare ancient flow directions to flood evidence

**Channel Migration Patterns:**
- **Point Bar Sequences**: Show where rivers deposited sediment on inside curves
- **Cut Bank Evidence**: Show where rivers eroded outside curves
- **Oxbow Lake Scars**: Abandoned river loops preserved in landscape
- **Time Indicators**: Each meander = thousands of years of river evolution

**Tributary Junction Analysis:**
- **Hanging Valleys**: Tributary valleys higher than main valley
- **Why This Happens**: Main river cuts faster than tributaries
- **Flood Modification**: Catastrophic floods disrupted normal tributary patterns
- **Modern Evidence**: Waterfalls mark pre-flood tributary elevations
