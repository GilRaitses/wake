one of my greatest Joys is reading the

book of history that the Earth has

written for us within the rock record

here I observe the sandstones deposited

within an ancient river some 57 million

years ago my goal is to help you read

this marvelous book

hello out there

boy am I excited to share with you the

geology of ancient river systems wow I

mean this is such a special place to me

it's some of the best outcrops in the

entire world to study these fluvial

systems or river systems

and it happens to be right in the in my

backyard in the middle of the Bighorn

Basin wow I'm pretty darn fortunate for

that

and also it's a special place for me

because I hiked out here a lot with my

dad and my great uncle and this is where

I started to be interested to become

interested in the rocks and Earth

history in geology

so I'm sure looking forward to this

now it turns out that there are several

different types of rivers or river

systems and the components that make

them up

and some of the videos that I release

over the next several months will focus

on certain River components or river

systems

in this first video on these ancient

Rivers I want to focus on the simplest

one of all which is basically a confined

channel that doesn't move around very

much I'm going to draw a sketch for you

to help us understand that

okay so the simple confined channel is

just like I've shown in this map view

looking from above of this river system

very simple and if we dig a trench

across here and look sideways so a

sideways view let me show you this one

some little brush here a little bit of

brush this is a fairly small Channel

they can be bigger or smaller

and we show a classic smiley face with

the bank here bank here and water in

here okay fairly obvious isn't it let me

put some sand in here just dot around

some sand

okay so it fills with sand and gravel

along the the bottom of this channel

okay

but of course there can be variations

and I'm just showing one

where you may have the bank of the river

come down a bit like so and then down to

a deeper Channel we call this a wing

of the channel

so that's just one variation of pretty

much an infinite number of variations

so now that we have these Concepts in

our mind that I've sketched here and

talked about let's get out and get our

hands on the Rock should we

foreign

isn't this a beautiful Channel I it's

just beautiful sitting here encased in

mudstone

I want to start with a small scale

channel that is also simple

cross-sectional view that's this one's

encased in mudstone as you can see

there's mudstone that surrounds it in

this mudrich system is very common and

just a beautiful Sandstone body that's

been deposited by this single Channel

just another small beautiful little

Channel this one of course is a

different shape more tabular shape they

come in all kinds of shapes

another beautiful isolated Channel we

have here huh

I see two stories or two levels in this

channel

an initial one that's smaller the lower

light colored one and then as it

broadened out and and got bigger

apparently and carried more sand it got

this bigger upper story that developed

or upper level

these are sure fun and they're all over

the place out here

whenever I see a large Channel like this

I start to imagine how difficult it

would have been to cross especially

while flooding for the early mammals

that roamed the great floodplains of

these Rivers some of these animals

included the early horse early Predators

early rhinos and pigs and giant

flightless birds and perhaps most

importantly the first primates were

hanging out in the trees around here

well it's sure been fun to see these

beautiful outcrops that show nice

cross-sectional views of channels but

you know sometimes we get even more

fortunate and we get even better

exposures and outcrops of channeled

Sands let me explain

so I have drawn a nice big layer of rock

here in blue with a channel within it so

it's mudstone around it here okay all

mudstone like we've seen in a nice

Channel

now sometimes the erosion comes in from

above nice and gentle rather than Steep

and rugged so what can happen

let me take my Eraser here and have a

right erosion come along knock that out

and at some point it gets to the channel

right and I'll put it right here a

little lower than the channel

the top of the channel

now we have a bit of an exposure of the

channel Sandstone above the ground

surface wow that's cool

and you know what's interesting is this

channel

is really durable and hard to erode

relative to the mud zones so here I am

on some of this nice durable hard

sandstone

and you might ask well how does this

happen how does it become so hard and

durable

well it turns out after the deposition

of nice soft Sands in the river or on a

beach they're buried and as they're

buried they're within the water table

look at the ground waters are flowing

through and they're mineral rich

and they begin to precipitate cement out

of the groundwater onto the sand grains

and bind each individual sand grain to

each other

and then of course it becomes very

durable there are various cements but in

this case it's calcite so this process

keeps going until

let me erase

okay

I can do something like this that that

occurs all the time out here in these

beautiful Badlands I can erode it to

where I have

a land surface let me erase this layer

of rock from erosion and this layer of

rock

okay and now

now I have the channel sitting on top of

a nice little Hill

and that's from side view and from above

what we see is this channel in a nice

ribbon of sandstone maybe something like

this okay

that's the top of this you're looking

down

that's when you get really lucky because

everything around it has eroded down

like I've depicted here all this

mudstone has eroded more easily and left

that on there that channel on there and

it leaves kind of a High Ridge a ridge

of mudstone with a channel on top now

that's super cool isn't it of course

they're all variations from barely

exposed channeled sandstone

on top to here and to where and then

they start start crumbling away and Big

Blocks falling to the ground so with

these Concepts in mind let's look at

some more beautiful outcrops of ancient

river sandstones

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

being out in geology in beautiful

landscapes brings such a sense of wonder

to me

what story is these Badlands have to

tell

[Music]

I want you to pay attention to this

Ridge right here it's capped with a

Sandstone that was deposited by a river

let's watch this

in this area the process of erosion has

yet to uncover this beautiful Channel

Sandstone remember at one time this

entire area was covered by several

thousand feet of sediments

and now we see the channel emerge from

the hillside

isn't this absolutely amazing we're

observing the actual River as it was

some 50 million years ago

I would like you to think like a

geologist and visualize a densely

treated subtropical Forest on each side

of this River and a thriving diverse

community of early mammals

the dinosaurs had died off some 15

million years earlier and now the age of

mammals was in full swing

here we see a gap where the channel has

been eroded away

here we see a beautifully exposed older

Channel sandstone in fact if you pay

attention you'll see several scattered

about along this flight path

keep in mind that at the time of this

River it was flowing in the low part of

the area and that now due to erosional

processes it is reversed and the fluvial

sandstones are on a High Ridge we refer

to this as inverted topography

and here I am thinking about the eocene

world

here I'm hiking along the top of a

beautiful Channel Sandstone but it's not

as well preserved as we've seen earlier

it's breaking up into large blocks

notice where the channel goes into the

hillside here

and now it exits the other side

well this is just really nice because

now we see that two channels merge to

form one channel

this V that it makes here where they

merge tells us which direction the flow

was at the time which would be in this

direction towards the camera

this principle of the V pointing down

river or Downstream is a great one to

know about however it doesn't work all

the time when the river ends and starts

to build a Delta into the ocean or a

lake

it actually starts to Branch Downstream

instead of Upstream so really what that

means is these V's Point Upstream at

that point

well geologists are always asking

questions

And when they see and observe these

various River types they ask well why do

we have various types and what controls

them

and and I want to touch on that I've

drawn a basin here the mountains here

and a basin okay and in this case the

Basin is being filled with river

sediments mud Rich lots of mud Stones

okay

and as the Basin is subsiding it's

filling in with sediments now it turns

out if the Basin is subsiding fairly

rapidly you're more prone to have these

isolated channels so let me show a

period I'll draw a big layer here

that's been filling in the Basin okay

and within it well we have our isolated

channels that I'm talking about

okay

now of course there are times when the

Basin isn't subsiding really it may stop

for a period of time and that's when

we're more prone to have sheet

sandstones or blankets of sandstone

layers of sandstone let me draw another

layer let's say there's a period right

through here I'll draw a big layer of

sediment okay within it instead of

having these isolated channels you may

be more prone to have sheet sandstones

which I'll be discussing in another

video

now as usual Nature's complicated I've

presented to you a fairly simple model

and yes this does can help control the

river systems and River types but that's

not the only thing

it turns out things like the climate con

affected the uh the sediment Supply the

type of rocks that are being eroded all

kinds of things but this is one of the

main drivers so looking at the

stratigraphic column we've been

observing these isolated channels in the

50 million year old Wilwood formation

now I want to go back in time some

hundred million years to the age of the

dinosaurs in the Jurassic Morrison

formation and overlying Cretaceous

Cloverly formation as you may know the

Morrison formation is one of the most

prolific Rock layers for finding

dinosaur bones in the Rocky Mountain

West

and it turns out what I want to show you

happens to be about 400 miles south of

the Bighorn Basin clear into the state

of Utah

let's go take a look at it

doesn't this look familiar I had my

son-in-law Jason record this Drone

footage a few years ago when we were

hiking the area

this channel sits about 30 feet above

the surrounding terrain and is about 40

yards wide

can you see it winding gently into the

distance

here are Jason and I

this area is an absolute Wonder to hike

in I especially like it because I'm

thinking about all these famous

dinosaurs that we're so familiar with

that were wandering around this region

and they were plentiful

in fact here's some dinosaur bones that

we found in the base of one of these

channels as we hiked about it turns out

that most dinosaur bones are found in

ancient Rivers

this chart published by the Utah

Geological Survey shows the amazing

diversity of dinosaurs found in the

Morrison and an overlying formation

named the Cedar Mountain

since we are talking about dinosaurs

let's go to a very special place about

100 miles north and look at these same

rock formations

this is Dinosaur National Monument a

place I would highly recommend that you

visit

this seemingly insignificant layer of

sandstone Within These steeply dipping

beds is where all the drama occurred

here is a closer look at this unit which

happens to be within the Morrison

formation it was deposited by rivers

that built broader sheet-like layers of

sandstone unlike the isolated channels

we've been observing

we'll be learning about these braided

river systems in a future video

it was within this very river system

that some 800 individual dinosaurs met

their demise

within the monument building we see a

large face of this steeply dipping

Sandstone that has been preserved along

with massive amounts of dinosaur bones

and to think that this is just a portion

of what was here most of the good bones

were taken to museums around the world

there's so much beautiful geology in

Utah it's just spectacular I love to go

there pretty much every year and hike

around and see some of that amazing

geology and scenery I was hoping to get

there this fall and do some more of the

recording here for this video on scene

but darn it couldn't get to it I do want

to show you a paleogeographic map which

means a map that shows us what the world

looked like in the past I'll show you

this Blakey map a Ron Blakey map for the

Jurassic the age of the dinosaurs

so here is this paleogeographic map a

map of the past 150 million years ago

when dinosaurs were wandering the land

this is primarily the United States it

gets up a bit into Canada

but I want to show you here Wyoming

outlined in black and Utah right here

we've been exploring the area in this

region of Utah for the Jurassic and you

see these river systems that shed off

the mountains the Highland mountains

these were called the severe mountains

or the severe erogeny which is older

than the laramide erogeny so this was

the landscape at that time

a good friend of mine has a wonderful

website called rock doc travel and it

goes into more detail about Dinosaur

National Monument I'll put a link to it

in the description of this video

I'm really enjoying the feedback that I

get from you the viewers it's very

helpful to me and one of the things that

I see that comes forward fairly often

are people that would love to get out

and see some jealousy and hike around in

it but they're unable because of maybe

their age their or they have health

issues or they just don't have access

you know I'm feeling a little bit of

that right now because I'll tell you

what it's cold here in Wyoming and I'm

not going out and doing that geology

myself

so while preparing this video I had a

flash of inspiration I was as I was

thinking about these issues and I

thought you know I could provide an

opportunity for you the viewers to do

some geology on your own right from your

home using Google Earth

so I've provided an image from Google

Earth that shows an area near Green

River Utah not Green River Wyoming Green

River Utah

find that in Google Earth and find this

image that you see on the computer and I

have highlighted on the image a couple

blue lines that Define a nice ribbon

of rock to study

and between those two lines are the

Jurassic age Morrison formation and the

overlying Cretaceous Cedar Mountain

formation and you're going to see some

really needed geologic features

especially channels and river systems

and you know what's neat about this is

there's not been a whole lot of study

done on this I've read a couple of the

professional papers

they've been done some time ago and they

only highlight some little areas okay so

in your own way you're going to be able

to do your new work and see new things

this is exciting

and maybe you'll even plan in the

springtime or fall not the summer it's

too hot out there to go out there and

spend some time set up a tent set up

your trailer went camping trailer

whatever and spend some time out there

and see what you've learned and touch it

with your hands and walk on it from what

you've found while doing your Google

Earth exercise

if there are some of you that haven't

used much of Google Earth that's okay

just go to YouTube and you'll find some

good tutorials on how to use it

I want to thank you for watching this

video and I hope that you're learning to

read the ancient history through the

rocks and that it gets you excited about

learning more through my videos of

courses one Avenue but even better to

get out on your own and start making

some observations thank you
