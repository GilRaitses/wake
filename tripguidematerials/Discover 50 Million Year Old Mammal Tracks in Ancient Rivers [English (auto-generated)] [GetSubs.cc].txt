here we see the Confluence of two

wonderfully exposed and exhumed River

channels that are some 50 million years

old in the desert of Wyoming

I love to hike along the tops of these

channels looking for Clues to Earth's

history

this channel caught my eye because

I think I see animal footprints in the

Sands here in the top of the channel let

me show you what I'm looking at I've put

my key to my Jeep there for scale so you

kind of know and see those depressions

in the in there they're here and there

everywhere

nice little round depressions here by

the key back off the edge and if I walk

along we'll see some more

some a nice one here

and here

here oh yeah look this looks like it

could have some toe prints in it

here here here

Etc

they're scattered about on that Boulder

there

really interesting

um they're all over in the in this CH on

top of this channeled sandstone

let me find a couple more

there's a nice one

further down the channel is this nice

example I'll be talking about this

Boulder more in a minute

boy this really captures my imagination

as a geologist because now I've been

looking at the depositional environment

thinking of these Rivers the the

beautiful vegetation

the subtropical climate averaging around

80 degrees Fahrenheit you know the

average temperature here in Wyoming

and all the animals about just a

spectacular ecosystem and now I get to

imagine these larger animals like maybe

a carifidon or or a uint ethereum or

other animals that are in the small

channels in these Rivers

walking around now that's not surprising

is it

now I know there are going to be many of

you out there wondering and thinking

well how do you know that those

depressions in that sand are are animal

footprints

and that's a fair question right and

and I understand that but let me

approach that in two ways the first way

is is that nature has patterns

and if you go in your own world wherever

you happen to be go to a Sandy Channel

whether it's an estuary or a little

Canal even a ditch

a small River and look at the top

surface and see what it looks like

you'll see some nice flow textures and

things like Ripples and and features

that are normal to the river

but depressions like this are unusual

and out of place

or anomalous and whenever I see that

whenever I see something out in nature

that's anomalous I start thinking well

what's going on here okay that's number

one the second thing I want to mention

is is that we can use analogs or

analogies and I happen to stumble one on

one excuse me right out here by this

channel interestingly enough so let's go

look at this what I think it could be an

analog okay

so right behind me here is the actual

channel that we've been walking on okay

and right here at my feet is a nice

trackway of well cows

turns out they're cows that graze out

here and I have my key out here for

scale and this cow had been walking in

the mud sinking in okay and you see a

nice pattern in the footsteps so that

makes it easier doesn't it it's harder

to see those in the channel

ah and you see these depressions

and sometimes the footprints are pretty

clear okay

and so now you recognize cow foot prints

out here cow tracks and then you notice

that even the subtle ones you start go

oh those are cow tracks those are cow

footprints

okay so we're following some cow tracks

here backwards actually this cow's

moving towards me there's a nice print

here

of the cow track and I want to use this

cow track to help you they're coming

along here you see them and then you see

subtleties out here in this out wash

here there's a natural flow right with

nature undisturbed

uh you wouldn't expect this very slight

depression or up here by my keys here

right

these subtle little depressions

so that's a good example to me as a

geologist this wash this little outwash

has a natural feel to it things that you

expect and then you have things that are

anomalous if I showed you just one of

these subtle depressions in this wash

you would never believe it was an old

cow track but when you have context then

it becomes pretty obvious and you go oh

yeah okay I've got it now that your eyes

have been tuned to cow tracks let's look

at a new area

what do you think of these see these

subtle depressions with a little mud in

there with mud cracks in there

yeah now you see something like this and

you think with confidence oh those are

just cow Footprints right

so that's a really powerful method that

geologists can use to help them

determine things that are out of place

and if you're observant as you walk

around nature you'll see some things

like that as well you'll start to

understand what is out of place shall we

say I wanted to show you this Boulder

that has broken off the channel here to

see some fascinating crayfish Burrows

see these small holes all over in here I

see burrowing everywhere in this

sandstone

and in this Boulder we see both crayfish

Burrows and tracks

did I just imagine in my mind you know

these happy animals standing in the

water maybe maybe eating some of the

grasses off the banks

so how did we preserve these tracks and

how do we know that these depressions

here weren't created much later

in time from weathering and erosion the

river at some point goes somewhere else

and it leaves in this abandoned it

abandons this area and the water is no

longer there but muds come in from

channels nearby during a flood stage you

may have seen that around in your part

of the world you know when a river

floods it leaves lots of mud

and here we go I'm depositing this red

mud but as you bury this the sand gets

cemented cement all the sand grains get

cemented together that's very very

common in sandstones so now we have a

hard Sandstone with these dimples and

surface features covered with mud stones

and we bring It Forward 50 million years

in time it got buried and buried now

it's back up to the uh being uncovered

by erosion so let me do that with my

fingers here and uncover this and it

turns out that the contrast on the

hardness is so much between the

Sandstone the cemented sandstone and the

soft mud stones that essentially reveals

a surface this beautiful surface that

you can walk around on on top of the

channels as you walk around on them it's

fun to do

you see these interesting shapes and

textures and and the crayfish Burrows

that are revealed

because it uncovers it as it was left

and I have actually gone to places where

you can find channels that that are

still just barely starting to be

uncovered you know they're up against

into a hillside or something and I can

walk let me put a little more mudstone

here

I can walk right up to here where it's

just been literally uncovered in the

last few years and guess what I can see

that same texture that I see back here

where it has been uncovered much longer

ago

so that helps us scientists a geologist

start to develop confidence that the

surface features they're seeing on here

on top of these channels really

represent what it looked like

it's the end of the day so I take some

time to do what I love the most

wander around in nature reading the

rocks and pondering my place in the vast

history of the Earth

why I hope you've enjoyed this little

Adventure we've gone on together

I'm really grateful for all of you that

watch these videos it it motivates me to

get out and hike around and do geology

and bring the geology to your home thank

you
