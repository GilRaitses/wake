in this video we will learn about a

massive volcanic complex that extends

from Yellowstone to the North and South

these volcanoes are older than the

Yellowstone Caldera and their eroded

remnants form the spectacular absor

mountains Within These gorgeous

mountains we will search for Clues to

the nature of the volcanoes that formed

various

Landscapes we'll learn about the

processes that form beautiful and

interesting

Rock wonderful features will be

investigated evidence of massive

volcanic forces will be explored and

we'll see amazing examples of

catastrophic

events we'll learn about many great

forests that were engulfed by volcanic

deposits and

petrified we'll discover a surprising

reason grizzly bears thrive in these

mountains and the importance of the to

Wildlife such as these big horn

sheep hello I'm myON cook Yellowstone

what a beautiful and fascinating place

to visit and learn about I know that

most of us well actually probably all of

us are familiar with the great hot spot

that lies underneath Yellowstone and

these giant eruptions that occurred as a

result you know the super volcano but

I'm going to let you in on a secret in

my opinion the best plac is to see

ancient volcanic features aren't even in

Yellowstone although they're right

adjacent to it and surprisingly many

people drive through these areas unaware

so it's my hope that this video will

inspire you to visit some of these areas

on your next trip to Yellowstone we'll

start this adventure along Highway 14

between Cody Wyoming and Yellowstone

National

Park I finally made it to the first

volcanic feature that I want to show

you I know many of you know how this

wall was created that stretches off into

the

distance it's quite striking isn't

it boy what a struggle to get to here I

had to push push through some heavy

brush there along the river across the

river I I was in water up over my knee

here uh and it's pretty Swift a bit

dicey and I'm in a bit of a hurry it

looks like rain's moving in on me but

I've done all this to come to this

magnificent volcanic wall it's a

volcanic Dyke where the hot magma forced

its way up fracturing the Earth bursting

to the surface it's really spectacular

and we have this wall preserved here and

I wanted to come here and see this and

put my hand on it I could see it from

the highway but so I'm I'm it's cool

it's really neat beautiful beautiful now

here comes the fun Imagine being

geologist back in the day and you first

come across these dkes like this you

know what the first thing you want to do

is yeah you want to trace it out not

only that you want to look for other uh

dkes like this one and you just keep

tracing them out and mapping them on a

map and if you're fortunate it could

reveal a marvelous pattern and this very

Dyke and many in this area uh help us

understand something rather spect

spacular actually quite spectacular

we've been focused on the Dyke extending

up into the mountains to the north but

it turns out it's also very interesting

to look to the South across the shishoni

river the side of the Dyke is here and

the shishoni river is here in the

distance and if you look carefully you

can see the Dyke in the mountain

side isn't this impressive not only do

we see the main Dyke we see other dkes

branching off of it here on the Steep

Mountain Side the Dyke doesn't form a

wall and it cuts way up nearly to the

top of the mountain it looks like it

ends right here I'm going to get over

there and put my hand on it it's a nice

fresh surface unfortunately I've got to

cross this River again and this time I'm

going to take a t the time and put a

little camera here on my tripod my

walking staff so you can see my

adventure it's a bit dicey the water's

pretty shallow for about half of it but

as you get across to the other bank

there it gets gets kind of deep and

pretty

Swift here we

go I've done these a few times in my

life cross these

Rivers uh the the rocks are quite

slippery I don't have special shoes on

for this I could get real wet and I

could definitely ruin some equipment

but no risk for me right up to my hip

pocket woo

I'm getting too old for

this still

deep wasn't I had a better route

crossing the first

time

hey hey guess

what I made

it oh boy well I made it h gosh I'm wet

all the way uh to the to my pocket

here bit much for me I don't know if

I'll do that too many more times it's

just it gets a little harder for your

balance as you get older but it'd be a

bit entertaining to take a swim if it

weren't for my equipment it wouldn't be

that big of a deal uh I hope you enjoyed

that amazing to see this Dyke in

crosssection it's been cut to make the

roadway for a little bit up here and

then it's a naturally steep mountain

side and you see this great

cross-section of this Dyke and it's the

very same Dyke we saw across the way

where it's naturally eroding into a wall

this is just as fun as it

gets following the Dyke further we see

that it points deep into the

mountains there are other spectacular

dkes that also Point deep into the

mountains in fact there seems to be dkes

everywhere the more you look the more

you see

if we Mark two of the dkes we visited on

Google Earth we don't see a pattern the

first one is about 4 mil long and the

second one is about 5 mil long one has

to wonder if they're related to each

other geologists M this region from the

mid 1960s through the mid90s and of

course they map the significant Dy shown

here with red lines wow that's a lot of

them this map is about 6 Mi wide but as

often as the case we need to see a

larger area to reveal the full picture I

digitized the dyes from the geology maps

and put them onto Google Earth it's

rather obvious that these dyes point to

the center of a massive volcano isn't it

it's referred to as the sunlight volcano

and last erupted about 48 million years

ago During the eosine period based on

observations we know it was a massive

strata volcano also known as a composite

volcano Mount Fuji of Japan and mount

kilamanjaro of Tanzania are two great

examples of strata

volcanoes of course we want to see what

the core of this volcano looks like

today after some 48 million years of

erosion this will be new to me I've

never been there before and I wonder

what I will see as I drive into the very

core of the volcano

as I get closer these two mountains

catch my

eye zooming in the features reveal

themselves the forces involved to

shatter these two mountains creating the

network of dkes captures my

imagination higher and higher we go what

do you think of this mountain of loose

Rock wow there's more than one mountain

of loose Rock

spectacular and rugged country isn't

it there's a lot to contemplate when

looking at this scene

what an amazing Drive coming up here

just spectacular I love it and I came up

as far as I could on this Jeep road

which has been destroyed by recent mass

movement and then another big hike up to

here and I could still keep going but

I'm running at a time CU there are at

least two other places I want to visit

by the end of the day but I'm here in

the belly of the Beast it's like you can

feel the energy of this ancient volcano

uh you see the great fracturing of the

rock with the dikes that have have

injected up into it through entire

Mountain sides it's just it's almost

overwhelming to think about the power

involved and the forces that this

volcano had and then you see uh evidence

of lots of erosion of all these taillor

slopes and if you look carefully you'll

see ridges on them and things that looks

like the rock is Flowing like a glacier

what's that all

about and then I have a question for you

how much of this volcano do you think is

eroded over the past 45 million years or

so was it is it a fourth of it uh maybe

a little less maybe more could it be

50% man that's a lot of erosion to think

that at one time maybe this mountain was

much much taller and how would you go

about determining how much of this

mountain eroded we're going to go uh

develop a method and I want you to think

about methods that you might would use

to determine how much erosion and how

big this volcano was at one time so this

is going to be a lot of fun

the amount of rock in these huge piles

of tus is rather

incomprehensible if you look carefully

you can see layered deposits such as

lava flows built up on on the side of

the

volcano the slope or the dip of these

layers is over

40Â° crusting over the mountain we see

the upper drainage of the shishoni

river all of this country is deep within

the core of the

volcano looking back we see the path

that I drove in the Jeep up this Great

Valley and here are the two mountains

that are filled with a vast network of

dkes well I'm about 2 and 1/2 miles to

the southeast of where we were with

another great view of this great volcano

and boy it was quite a Jeep trip I

wouldn't have known how to get here it's

a bit tricky but fortunately my brother

is with me to show me the way so he's

he's along with me on this trip and I'm

really grateful is with me because we

got a flat tire down and down the

roadways back there and it's pretty it's

pretty good work you know moving around

these big tires so I'll say hi to Elgen

here and I'm grateful for his

help we see mountains of tus like we saw

at the other

location if you look closely you can see

me I'm a bit camouflaged

though the massive amount of rock we is

a testament to how quickly erosion can

tear a mountain

down again we see evidence of great

forces

involved I'm sure you're curious about

the patterns that you see in these huge

piles of rock I'll do a separate video

on that in the

future what an amazing place it's really

very inspiring to me I see this Great

Wall here there's some evidence of

mineralization here I'm close to the

very heart of this great volcano and to

think about the great eruptions occur

that occurred and then the steady

erosion the power of erosion how it's

just tearing this mountain down I mean

very

quickly but turning back to you know

some 45 million years ago to think about

the impact it had on the Great Plains

surrounding this volcano uh especially

off to the uh East where you had

subtropical climate you had many early

mammals running around enjoying their

lives early horses hippos the early

predators and many other animals living

out there and piece and tell this guy it

went off and then well you can imagine

can't you but what a wonderful place I

recommend getting up here if you have a

a really good four-wheel drive it has to

have a low gear range and a jeeper

smaller and you can make your way up in

here of course there's the option of

hiking it'd be a pretty good hike to get

up into this country but it's worth it

it's worth it

the absor mountains are a magical place

to be especially in the spring it is so

peaceful and

inviting but I must say I enjoy them

during all the seasons winter is Harsh

yet

beautiful it was during the harsh winter

in this very area where Charles Beldon

captured this image on the historic

pitchfork

Ranch he became famous for capturing

images of ranch life on the Pitchfork in

the early

1900s I love his photos and I think

black and white photos often capture the

scene better than

color I took this photo years ago in

these mountains which I feel captures

the mood of volcanic terrain

well as I drive up the mountain on this

late summer day I reflect on the beauty

of eroded volcanoes and the astounding

geology I have encountered

here the top of the mountain here has a

rather gentle terrain far different from

what we've seen

earlier I haven't hiked over to this

outcrop before but it sure looks

intriguing really interesting deposit

isn't it what do we see about this what

do we note well first of all we've got

to talk about the color it's very light

colored unusually light colored it's uh

ranges from very fine grain is when I

look at it carefully and I'll show you

some closer photos but very fine grained

and we get also some pebbl siiz class in

here even there's some pretty good

Pebbles you know four or five times the

size of marbles in here and as I look

elsewhere they can even get bigger I

also see really faint uh bedding in here

fine lamina that are dipping within here

in various

directions and we think about the system

that we're in a volcanic

system and you start putting it together

you think well what's light colored

volcanic ash could it be that this has a

lot of volcanic ash in it well in fact

yes it has a lot of Ash within

it and uh one Telltale sign for me just

to come up here and put my hand on it

man I feel like if I were to rub my hand

on here very hard it would just grate

and and make my hand bleed just scrape

it all up that's all that volcanic glass

that's within here under the microscope

we see the lithified ash which is

referred to as tough I've included a

needle in the image for scale these are

small particles of minerals rocks and

Volcanic glass although the glass I

think is hard to see most of the outcrop

is a tough dominated by angular rock and

mineral

fragments but it isn't Ash that has just

Fallen to the ground and is sitting

there currently it's actually been

reworked which is very common so the ash

fell to the ground and the local rivers

and streams picked it up transported it

and redeposited into River deposits flal

deposits which include the corser grain

uh material uh up to the very fine and

we see the cross beding within it so

it's a fascinating unit sitting right

here on top of the mountain I'm sure

glad I walked over to this outcrop

because right next to it I found

something pretty special

a double window with some amazing

geology surrounding

it I think I could spend easily a half

hour studying the geology of this one

small area we'll be learning about these

types of deposits soon earlier this

spring I did a flight to investigate

some areas of the absor mountains and I

found something that really got my

attention and after a long Jeep ride I

still have a good ways to go to

investigate what I'd found my goal is to

get way out here on this

point I'm a bit hard to see I'm walking

along the top of a lava flow that looks

like Basalt but it's lava that is quite

rare and is called a

trachyandesite in fact this sequence is

named the trout Peak

trachyandesite trachyandesite is

dominated by sodium rich plag and Alkali

Feld bar but this lava flow isn't why I

came out here what I'm here for lies

below the lava and it is

mindblowing let's let the mountain speak

for itself as it's

revealed be patient

what do you think the darker shapes

are are these catching your

eye here are some of them make sure and

notice the mature pine trees it helps

you understand just how big these blocks

are the more you look the more you see

here's a big

guy wow what an amazing mountain wasn't

it fun to just see the geology reveal

itself just as you saw more and more and

you started to understand what was going

on at least to some level I mean I had

that process of discovery when I saw it

it took me a while to start to put it

all together and it just got more

exciting by the minute and I hope you

enjoyed thinking about well how did this

happen what's going on here why are

these giant blocks in the mountain side

now that's fun to think about isn't it

and I'm sure many of you have figured it

out at least to some level and well now

I have the Whiteboard to help us out

with this uh let's go to to the first

over here we have the great volcano I've

even put a few little fancy red lines

here to show some heat coming out of the

top and I have this blue line here that

represents a fault a breakaway where the

side of the mountain just broke free and

came out kind of like St Helen's maybe

something similar what Mount St Helen's

did and a giant debris flow or Lahar

when we have volcanic uh debris flows

they're referred to as lahars they can

have be very muddy they can have small

rocks big rocks and in this case man

some massive massive pieces entrained

within it so if we look down upon this

Lahar this flow it flows out and widens

out at the at the toe of it like I've

shown here if we could just use our

imagination here and cut a deep trench

right across this big Lahar this is a

giant lahar cut it right through here

deep deep through the whole thing and

look at it sideways well this is what

this is supposed to represent so we have

a cross-sectional view complete with my

little tree here and in actuality if I

were to draw this to scale this tree

would be way way smaller wouldn't

wouldn't it because it's these blocks

are just huge huge relative to this tree

so at any rate we have this massive

Lahar and within it these giant blocks

and they're suspended in Matrix The

Matrix is all the material between it

between the blocks and it was mud and it

had a high density in fact the density

of the mud was very similar to the

density of these giant blocks and that's

why they could kind of float in it and

be transported without breaking all up

and not contacting each other like you

see with rocks and rivers and stuff

because the rocks and a river you know

they're in a low density fluid and and

they're banging around on each other and

when they settle down they're touching

each other unlike what we see here you

know I could hire a young person to help

me out that really knows computers and

the right software to create a a nice

animated uh 3D view of a huge Lahar

coming off a volcano but personally I

like to use what's right here our

imagination so I want you to just

imagine for a minute just standing off

to the side and seeing this enormous

flow of debris coming down off the

volcano way out into the flats and

piling up like this it must have been

astounding so there you have it gigantic

pieces of the sunlight volcano that

broke free were enveloped in mud and

transported many miles after this great

Landslide great lava flows and other

volcanic deposits exceeding 2,000 ft

were deposited over the top of it hit

we're not sure just how far it traveled

but we do know that the center of the

sunlight volcano is some 35 mil away I

think it likely traveled 20 to 30 miles

absolutely

astounding there are other examples of

these Mega lahars normally this one

would seem very impressive but not

compared to the one we just

explored but there is another truly

spectacular one that I got a sing single

photo of from an airplane notice the

mature trees for

scale with the principles we've learned

we can have some fun analyzing this

amazing mountain how would you draw the

boundaries of this Lahar what do you

think the sequence of events was to

create this mountain do you see two

distinctive parts to this Lahar let's

start by mapping the top of the lar this

is where I think it

is it seems to me that there are two

parts to this lar an upper part and

lower the lower where is where all the

giant blocks are and the upper part

seems to be more layered and has fewer

blocks the blue line is where I place

the contact between these two parts I

think you could make the case to draw it

somewhat differently than this but this

is my

interpretation on the right side of this

flow I think you see evidence that this

filled a large Canyon to me the base of

the flow seems to be plunging down

steeply the green line is where I put

the base at least what you can see of it

I really like this Mountainside exposure

because you can see the original shape

of much of the Lahar and it's dramatic

but I also really like this outcrop

because you can clearly see what

happened after the Lahar was deposited

there were many thick lava flows of

trachyandesite that filled in around it

and over the top of it if you focus your

eyes on laring within the lava it helps

you see it more

clearly I've drawn in a few of the

layers with blue lines this helps us

clearly see how the lava flowed right up

to the massive Lahar as it filled up

around it it's a pretty spectacular

Mountain Side isn't it as you'll recall

a while back I asked you to think about

how you would estimate the height of

this ancient volcano how tall was it

and thereby uh figure out how much

erosion has occurred in the last 45

million years or so and these are really

fun things to think about it helps you

imagine this whole scene that that was

present at the time and I hope you've

had fun thinking on this and I'm going

to give you a major clue I think the key

to this to this estimation is using

modern

analoges Mount St Helens of Washington

state is a well-known example of a

strata of volcano and the Mayan volcano

of the Philippines is a great example of

a strata of volcano it has that classic

shape we are all familiar with the

beautiful Mount Fuji of Japan also has a

very classic shape and then there's the

mighty kilamanjaro of

Tanzania there are over 700 strata

volcanoes in the world and a very high

percentage of them have that classic

shape to them this rather predictable

shape can be used to our advantage in

estimating the sizes of ancient Strat

volcanoes I think we can assume that the

ancient ones also had similar

shapes the assumption that we make that

strata volcanoes have similar shapes is

a very powerful thing to use it's a

great tool to use into the past because

now we can start to understand how big

these volcanoes could be in the past and

I've got a cross-section here of

Fuji and the dark line here is the

ground that the volcano built upon it's

not sea level it's the

ground and I have of course Mount Fuji

now the thickness of the volcanic pile

or sometimes I refer to it as the

vertical relief of the overall volcano

is about

11,400 ft and the radius of it the

distance from the center to the edge of

the volcanic material deposited is about

8 Miles so that's one um member that we

can put on this sketch let's sketch

kilamanjaro which is much bigger let me

try to do that here oh I'm going to

bring it about here and up like this

something like

that well kilamanjaro the vertical

relief on that is about

15,800 ft and the radius from the center

out to the edge is about 20

mil so we have two points for us to

consider two analoges and now we can

place the sunlight

volcano so what we're trying to get at

is the vertical relief of the ancient uh

sunlight volcano and then we can have

fun with how big it it was when it was

active and how much erosion has

occurred so the one thing we know is the

approximate radius or at least we can

use a proxy to estimate that r IUS and

right now we're using the dyes that

we've seen now that as we get more

information we might decide that that's

a bit uh wrong shall we say that we need

to adjust it and I have a feeling it's

going to get bigger but for now let's

use those dkes and the radius of those

is about 12 miles so if we do that and

say the radius is about 12 miles and and

sketch something in I'll make it in blue

here um I'll I'll go something like

this just a like something like

that it's in between uh Fuji and

kilamanjaro uh closer to Mount Fuji and

if you do some math and think about it

you come up with a vertical relief of

about 13,000 ft and with that knowledge

we can think about

erosion but first I need to give you

some important information There Are

Places where you can see the contact

between the sedimentary rock formations

and the volcanic material that was

deposited upon it all the material below

the home on this Ridge is sedimentary

not volcanic and the darker colored

mountains in the background are all

volcanic a Google Earth view gives us a

better perspective the prior photograph

was taken right here in this area and

here we can clearly see the contact

between the volcanic and the sedimentary

the elevation of the contact is variable

but on average is around 6,500 ft an

even higher view is quite informative

because we clearly see how the shason

river has cut down through all the

volcanic material to reveal the

sedimentary rocks underneath we also see

the light color here which is at the

very core of the

volcano finally the full picture comes

into view with the radial dkes pointing

to the very core

now comes the fun I want you to create a

picture in your mind of How High this

volcano might have been above the

current landscape for reference the

Peaks within the uh core are about

11,500 F feet or so tall Jacob Ruffner

an expert in GIS reached out to me and

offered to help he created a scaled

model of the volcano over this very

terrain and it expresses well the image

I had painted it in my mind thank you

Jacob the spectacular mountains at the

core we visited seem so small underneath

this once great volcano

astounding if we take the elevation of

the ground level that the volcano built

upon of 6,500 ft and add the vertical

relief of 13,000 ft we get an elevation

of

19,500 Ft for the

peak to help us understand the size of

this mountain we can take the Gateway

Arch of St Louis and place it to scale

in the

model can you see it it's very small

when you do the calculations you find

that about 2/3 of the volcano has been

eroded yes 2/3 and soon we'll make some

observations that suggest it's even more

than that also I want to mention that at

the time this volcano was active the

base of it wasn't too far above sea

level but about 10 10 to 15 million

years ago a vast region along the Rocky

Mountains was uplifted bringing the base

up to about 6,500 ft this particular

video has been quite a project for me I

started filming in the spring and it's

continued right into September and the

more I explore the more I find that I

want to share with you I've learned so

much recently I realized that I've just

got too much material for one video so

I've decided to break it into two parts

now in the second video we're going to

see and learn some amazing things uh

like about the many fossil forests or

about the other volcanoes and their role

in building the absor mountains we'll

find out that strata volcano shouldn't

even be here in Wyoming what's that all

about in fact geologists are still

debating as to exactly why they're here

and we'll have fun learning about what

happened when the Great Yellowstone

hotspot met these absor of

volcanoes oh and we will not forget the

grizzly bears I hope you'll join me in

the next video thank you for watching

and would you consider subscribing thank

you
