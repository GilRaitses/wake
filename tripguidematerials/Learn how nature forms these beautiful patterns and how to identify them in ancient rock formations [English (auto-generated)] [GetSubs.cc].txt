there's so many beautiful patterns that

nature provides us to enjoy and some of

the most inspiring ones come from Rivers

in this video we will learn how this

intricate beauty is formed and how to

recognize rivers in the ancient Rock

record

as I walk along the top of this 50

million year old Meandering River I

Ponder how very fortunate I am to live

near to some of the best exposures of

ancient rivers in the world

why hello and welcome in this ancient

river series that I'm doing I want to

focus on the Meandering river system

Meander Meandering rivers or or windy

rivers are very interesting the

Mississippi River is one of those

small Mountain Streams and mountain

valleys often can be a Meandering system

and they're interesting because they can

often deposit large sheets of sandstone

unlike the confined channels that we've

seen in in part of my other series as

you learn to read The Rock record you

will observe that these distinctive

deposits are indicative of strongly

Meandering River or fluvial systems

first I want to show you a

cross-sectional view of a channel in a

meander river system so this represents

some brush over here so you make sure

you're looking Acro from a cross section

from a side perspective the water is

Flowing down the channel here's the

water level

the channel is steep sided over here

that's the Cut Bank okay so we want this

River bending sharp and cutting into

here every time it floods or even not

sometimes it'll cut a little won't it

but you get a flood going and man it'll

it can cut significant amounts

near my house where I have a cut Bank

I've seen it cut 20 yards in one major

flood just cutting back okay

and here is represents the first little

sand body this little wedge here

on the point bar so this is called the

point bar and of course there's going to

be sand and gravels in the bottom here

of the channel where the highest flow is

the lighter colored Sandy area on the

inside of this River Bend is the active

Point bar so as that cuts let's do that

A big flood comes along right

and cuts back here like so

okay

now the new channel Bank on this side

is over here not complicated right

it's like that it moves over

and what happens here well it accrets

lateral accretion it accretes a new body

of sand

like this okay

and this the dips on here are

exaggerated often we do that when we're

sketching geology it's not that steep

but it you know they're nice dipping

beds okay

well what do you think happens if you

cut more it's pretty obvious you know I

cut more and the process continues right

hey cut more

and more and more and I'm going to cut

it back hypothetically clear over here

just just to help us put in a few of

these

okay so it cut out the brush here

it's really moved along huh well it just

continued through each flood event just

puts in new Sandstone layers and a new

channel profile okay moving along and

this builds can build a nice body of

sand that's this thick in this schematic

this is a great example of these dipping

beds are lateral accretion surfaces on a

point bar let's start with the channel

early and it's life okay The Cut Bank to

orient ourselves is out in the air here

we don't see the actual bank it's out to

the out Beyond just a bit

the the river was going around a Big

Bend okay so with the Cut Bank over

there

the point bar was right where I'm

standing here

so let's start with the lower one this

is when the the river first started here

the first point bar in the river right

here at the bottom

then a flood came in or floods

this is probably a series of them here

but it might even be one

came in and accreted on another big uh

body of sand on this accretion surface

on the front of the point bar

so if I would have been here on the

river I could have walked right down

this top of this point bar that's where

the water was just to try to visualize

that and so on Through Time a creating

on out okay and then eventually the

river jumped to another location or a

volst

I want to make a couple more points

using the sketch board

at the bottom of the river of course is

higher energy and therefore you leave

lag deposits we call them which are

coarser grained and I've depicted that

along here in the sketch these coarser

deposits

and also the point bar deposits often

leave little ridges along the top that

I've depicted here these are referred to

as scroll bars and in map view they tend

to have a nice Arc shape

let's use a perspective view to help us

understand the three-dimensional

geometries

this is the flood stage of the river

that I'm showing here and this is

important because it's during the flood

stage that you actually accrete on new

sand bodies on the point bar that we've

talked about notice that the scroll bars

conform to the shape of the river so

they have that nice Arc shape I like to

say that they wrap around the inside

corners of the river

so the point bars wrap around the inside

Bend of the river and importantly they

dip down towards the cup bank or the

Deep part of the river I want you to

notice that the slopes or dips of these

Point bars alternate so here in the

front Point bar we're looking at it

slopes to the left but yet on the next

Bend of course it flips and slopes down

to the right

these arrows show the dip or slope

direction of each point bar alternating

along the river path

ephemeral streams are a great place to

see Point bars I'm walking right along

the point bar

and I'm standing right on the point bar

okay and notice that it's dipping down

like this

now some Rivers the dips are a little

steeper

and some are shallow like this and it's

a big bar that wraps around the corner

I'm walking along out here in this

beautiful Painted Desert and I see the

perfect example of a miniature Point bar

it's just beautiful see this dipping

surface that goes right into the Cut

Bank under here it's gorgeous and it

makes this really tight corner so the

water is Flowing around this way

let's come around here and take a look

at this as it comes right around the

corner

right around

so nice as it comes around the corner

with these ripples very subtle parallel

to the to the point bar right here

really gorgeous

these amazing images are referred to as

lidar images and are made by using

lasers to create a super high definition

data set of the topography or elevation

changes of the land surface let's zoom

in and take a look at Point bar deposits

wow this is just amazing because you can

actually see all the scroll bars

deposited by this River if we focus just

on this one turn in the river we see how

these scroll bars describe the history

the shape of the river through time

it's really fun to think about and look

at the other scroll bars in this image

to wonder about the history of this

River

if you colorize the lidar data you

reveal such beauty it's a work of art in

a way isn't it

but also it gives us a lot of Science

and a lot of information because in fact

again you're seeing the history of the

river right in front of you let's

examine this band in the present-day

river right here these faint lines

through this area are of course the

scroll bars which represent Point bar

deposits of the past the darker Shades

back in here are the oldest Point bar

deposits that we can see and they

progressively get lighter in color and

younger until you get to the modern

River I'll tell you what I could look at

these images for hours they're so

fascinating and beautiful at the same

time

here is a wonderful example of Point bar

deposits and scroll bars along the

Porcupine River in Alaska

I think it's time to go look at the

ancient rocks these are from the 50

million year old eocene age Wilwood

formation

do you see anything on this Hillside

that catches your eye

let me help you out a bit let's zoom

into this area

as a geologist I just can't tell you how

amazing this outcrop is we don't get the

chance to see such beautiful outcrops

everywhere we go but this is one of them

I hope you're seeing features that I

showed you on my sketch board

now this is going to be fun because

we're going to see how well you did with

your observations let's start with the

erosional base or scour of the actual

channel that we can see here

now what about the top of the channel

system do you think you can see it

now that we've identified the envelope

of the system let's focus on the

interior features

here is one of several Point bar

deposits within this system using the

principles we've learned we can now

estimate where the Final Cut Bank was

where it was just before the river

jumped to a new location or a volts

remember that this River was cutting or

migrating to the left adding Point bar

deposits through time and that the cup

Bank also was cutting progressively to

the left

here's another nice example of Point bar

deposits

and another fine example of these

dipping laterally accreted sand bodies

but one thing you can certainly count on

in geology is that things get complex in

red is the envelope of a relatively

young river system that has cut or

truncated an older river system that

I've highlighted in Black

as I drive through the Badlands I try to

visualize all the ancient rivers that

created these beautiful Hills and I

think about the ecosystem at the time

I'm excited to take you to the next Rock

exposure it is so very rare it allows us

to see in three dimensions a river that

is 50 million years old

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

even with grayed outcrops visualizing

the three-dimensional nature of them can

be tricky so I want to return to this

sketch to help us with a couple Concepts

that we'll be seeing in the Rock

remember that the point bar deposits

slope downwards towards the channel

where the Cut Bank

and that the and the deposits wrap

around the corner in the shape of the

River on the inside bends also remember

that the slope of these Point bar

deposits flips from one direction to the

other on each curve of the river as you

go down the river

this whole channel has been weathered

out and it's leaving the bends of the

river in with the lateral accretion

surfaces and the point bars intact

largely intact or intact enough to see

okay

so let me show you what I'm talking

about if if I look at this surface right

here okay it's going around the corner

so this Sandstone body or Point bar

wraps around the corner and dips

downward towards the channel or Cut Bank

right here

and another cool one is this one

this is I as near as I can tell as the

very last bar that the river deposited

okay so here it is

and you can see it it goes kind of

around here it's eroded away there but

here's the front of it right here

this upper Point bar or the youngest one

is heavily eroded but one can still see

enough information to put the picture

together at one time before the erosion

it was a nice continuous sand body that

wrapped around the corner

it's eroded away where I am but here's

the front of it wow

and the river where was the river at the

time put this last bar in well this was

deep water at the time this is where the

deep water was

now I want to show you what it looks

like right down the plunge of a point

bar

look at this is

here's one there's one here there's this

one

there's this one

oh wow and it just wraps around wraps

around

and then you have this big guy here the

final one

I'll tell you what geology just doesn't

get any better than this

looking from above we can clearly see

many sand bodies accreted on the point

bar Through Time

following the ancient river we see the

point bars dipping to the left

and as we go along now we see that

there's they have switched and are

dipping back to the right

along this section it's not as obvious

to see so let's move forward

here we see sand bars dipping to the

right

and now back to the left

well you've heard me talk about how the

rivers jump to new locations it's a

process we call avulsion

and you might wonder well how does that

happen or why does it happen and I

wanted to get into that just a minute so

we understand that

I have depicted here in cross-sectional

view a a river system here with my tree

here okay and it is recently cut in a

channel and has some water flowing in it

if you think to when you stand on the

bank of a river where does the high

velocity occur the velocity the high

velocities of the river occur in the

deepest part of the channel or within

the channel

and that's true in flood stage too if

the flood if the water gets up high and

bursts the banks the highest velocity is

always going to be right in the core of

that channel

but there's an interesting thing that

happens when the flooding occurs so let

me draw that here the water comes up

out over the banks out here to the trees

out in here

now we have high velocity Waters during

flood stage that are carrying all kinds

of sand grains coarser grains mud

everything right the mud everything

right in the core where it has enough

energy to carry even the larger

particles in the system which in these

systems tends to be maybe say coarse

grain sand

so during flooding as the water rises up

over the lip here the the speed or the

velocity of the water drops dramatically

and that means all the particles

primarily sand in this case drop out of

suspension they're entrained in the

water but when the velocities drop they

just drop

right to the floor wherever that is and

here it happens to be here in this area

right here

okay

and this happens over and over again and

it builds what we call levees these are

called levees so I'm going to make it

kind of dramatic here

right like this

and we build these nice levees of sand

and interestingly in an aggrading system

where the river is filling in sediment

in a basin like in the Bighorn Basin

like where we've been looking here in

the Wilwood formation then the bottom of

the channel also keeps arising along too

like this

up and up the bottom and the levees get

taller and taller and bigger and taller

at some point this creates a very

unstable situation because now the

bottom of the river is very close to the

floodplain level and in fact there are

cases where it gets above the flood

plain the bottom of the river because

it's continually grading these levees

are building up so let me put normal

water flow right here

that's above the flood plain out here

and so of course the river wants to go

out there so you have a flood come along

and breach the Levee during flood sage

and the river says hey I'm going to go

over here where it's lower and so you

have the river

jump to a new location sometimes it's a

short place sometime or for a short

section I mean and other times the

entire River jumps to a new location

so looking down from above in map view

I've sketched the river here

the river often moves around in fairly

close areas to the main Channel it'll

break through to a new area and and

proceed on but sometimes it does a big

jump it might break loose here out of

here and come out into the flood plain

and go off over here like this over a

long stretch of the river so you have

the full range of things that can occur

let's return to Modern rivers and learn

a bit more

going to the uka'ali river of Peru which

is a major tributary of the Amazon we

can learn more about these Meandering

systems

one thing I want to mention about these

Meandering fluvial systems is that they

are low gradient meaning the slope is

very low and they have finer particles

that are transported fine-grained sand

is pretty typical for instance and can

have a lot of mud as well

let me highlight the river path from

this image in 1987 and then we'll watch

how it changes Through Time

here it is in

1991. notice this tiny little channel

right here

so just one year later in 1993 we see

the entire River has taken the path of

that small Channel we call that a shoot

cut off because it cut off the big

Meander Loop

just three years later in 1996 we see

another example of a small Channel which

will become a shoot cut off

in 1997 much of the river was following

this cutoff and by the year 2000 the

entire River was flowing down that cut

off

jumping to the year 2020 we see just how

much the river has changed in a mere 33

years wow

so here we are at the Porcupine River in

Alaska wow what a lot of ancient scars

from the river you can see in here these

horseshoe shaped lakes or Oxbow shaped

Lakes are called oxbow lakes

in 1944 a geologist by the name of

Harold Fisk published a series of 15

beautiful Maps which show all the

ancient channels of the Mississippi

River

this stunning lidar image of the pack

River teaches us an important concept

and that is that Meandering Rivers tend

to be confined to a bell the Meander

belt that we're observing is completely

dominated by sand therefore what we

often see are sheets or blankets of

sandstone an isolated Meander River

channels are not too common

here is a nice example of a sheet sand

that formed within a meander belt that

I've highlighted in red it is eocene age

which is about 50 million years old

looking at this sheet Sandstone it's

important to remember the effects of

erosion at one time there were thousands

of feet of sedimentary rocks over the

top of this system only recently has

erosion revealed part of this blanket

sandstone and some of it has been eroded

away

I put these white lines to show where it

has been removed by erosion

and now to an astounding outcrop of rock

in Utah this is Jurassic age Morrison

formation many dinosaurs wandered this

land here and in fact many bones come

out of this very sandstone

how many different Rivers can you see

that have made up this sheet Sandstone

it's amazing to think about isn't it

hiking these desolate yet beautiful

Badlands gives me so much opportunity to

wonder about Earth's long history and

our place in it

well this has been a lot of fun for me

and I hope you're getting better at

reading the book of Earth's history by

watching these videos thank you for

watching
