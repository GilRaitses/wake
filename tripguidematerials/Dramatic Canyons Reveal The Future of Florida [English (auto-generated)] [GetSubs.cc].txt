the various Landscapes that we enjoy

seeing and traversing hold more

information than we can possibly imagine

this is true for apparently

uninteresting areas as well as the

Majestic for those who seek the

knowledge held Within These Landscapes

Treasures of the past and future can be

found in this video we will seek

knowledge held within dramatic Canyons

that reveals not only past events but

informs us of the future in particular

these desert Canyons provides us insight

into the future of Florida and other

regions such as the Yucatan Peninsula of

Mexico what a beautiful fall day to go

up into the foothills of the Big Horn

mountains of Wyoming I've never been to

this location and I'm looking forward to

it these Pronghorn antalope add extra

enjoyment to my trip

[Music]

the quiet isolated beauty of this

Majestic Canyon exceeds my my

expectations amazing isn't it the the

beauty of this Canyon is just so

inspiring to me and that's what I do

when I first come upon a landscape like

this I take some time to just enjoy the

beauty of it but it doesn't take me long

to start thinking about deep time and

thinking about the the geologic

processes that occur to to create this

Canyon before me wow and in this case it

started about 350 Million Years Ago by

with the deposition of this Limestone

that I'm standing on that forms this

Canyon the majority of this Canyon we

see and it was deposited in clear warm

ocean waters there were reefs in these

oceans and other animals like Brach pods

enjoying the warm Seas but times change

and in this case Continental deposits

like rivers and desert deposits came in

and were deposited on top of this

Limestone and pushed the sea Waters away

and then there were periods of new

oceans coming in and then a desert again

and and rivers Etc and the ocean again

different types of oceans warm and

cold uh building up deposits on top of

this

Limestone built it up to some 12 ,000

ft and then about 10 million years ago

there was a big broad uplift through

this whole region that uplifted

everything and this caused erosion to

start to occur instead of deposition and

building up erosion cutting down through

all this 12,000 ft of rock this sediment

had turned a rock by this time down down

to come right back to this Limestone

again and after some 340 million years

or so this Limestone got to see the

light of day again boy that's a long

time to be in the dark isn't it and

although I usually focus on the the Deep

past and most people when they think of

geology and geologic history we think of

the past you know what happened millions

of years ago but it turns out it can

give us insight into what could happen

in the future as well deep time in the

future and in this case this Canyon and

the canyon surrounding here Harbor some

important Clues as to the future of

Florida that's right the future of

Florida let's let's learn how that could

possibly be there is something very

peculiar hidden in the walls of this

Canyon and other canyons in the

region our first job is to scan the

walls and look for anomalous geologic

features and then develop Concepts that

explain what we

observe this is such such a fun process

because you never know where the path of

Discovery will take

you what about these distinctive White

Lines we see in The Cliff face could

that be a clue well they are interesting

and quite distinctive but in this case

it's not what we're looking

for other distinctive features we notice

is the red coloring that we often see

near the top and also the propensity for

caves up in that area this is close

we're getting warmer

standing on this Majestic Overlook I'm

looking at a fine example of the

mysterious feature we

seek there is an unusual body of red

colored Rock in this area and it seems

like there is a red staining on the

walls below it another perspective of

the same layer it runs along this

line it sure has an interesting shape

doesn't it a closer look makes it even

more interesting what's going on how did

it form I highlighted it here so we get

a clear view of the interesting shape of

this layer with this knowledge it's

quite easy to recognize the layer in

Canyon

walls note the boat for

scale notice that the irregular shaped

layer that we've been observing rests

upon horizontal layers that are well

behaved and and if you look carefully

you can see quite horizontal layers

above this uh

layer here's a very nice view of the

layer and of course I think you're

wondering well what does it look like

when you look closely and closer let's

take a look well this is fascinating

isn't it what do you find interesting

about

it looking at this there's a lot to

absorb in here but I want to focus on

one simple thing and that that is it

looks like a lot of broken up Rock to me

also it looks like the individual class

have angular edges I would call this a

breta I think it's time to have a

whiteboard discussion and discuss these

breta deposits and and where we see them

or how they form and I've got a

cross-sectional view here so I think I

need to draw my little tree don't I I'll

put it right here I'll put a nice little

pine tree it's getting closer to

Christmas here we have the pine tree and

this represents a big Cliff here like a

mountain-sized cliff much bigger than

I've shown the tree here and on the side

of the cliff it can break up and fall

can't it so big pieces can come off and

break and form a taillor slope of of

angular Rock so I'll put it in here just

very angular uh Rock of various sizes of

pieces here deposit building this

taillor slope now that is a breta if it

gets cemented through time and buried

which it does in the geologic record it

can in form a breta deposit and down to

this part of the sketch which is also

cross-sectional uh I've drawn a heavy

line which is a fault uh the arrow here

showing that this side went up it broke

the rock these layers of rock say this

blue and red layer broke it and lifted

it up

so it's in this case a compressional re

regime and there a lot of forces along

this fault as you might imagine which

breaks the rock up and you can have a

Zone along the fault that is um composed

of breta from this broken up Rock so

that's another way to do it can you

think of other ways that breta could

form I'm thinking of glaciers I mean

they break up a mountain and angular

pieces of rock could fall on the glacier

and it could deposit areas at least of

angular Rock That Could form a

breta uh ous activities such as a

volcano as it goes off I mean there are

a lot of forces involved there and it

could break up the Rock and does and

does form breta also the intrusion of

granite bodies and other types of of

magma that come in and break up the rock

around it as it's intruded in and it can

form a breta there so these are all very

interesting ways to do it but you know

as I think about it I don't think any of

these processes we've discussed fits

what we've seen you know what we

observed in these Canyon walls because

we have breta within a layers of

limestone and as I think about this I I

can't really make it work and this is

what's fun when you're out in the field

making observations you're immediately

going through all the ways to create

these bretches

and trying to figure out how it occurred

so in my mind this means that there's

yet another way to create breta maybe

some of you have already figured that

out to learn about another breta forming

process we go to Mexico near the city of

Tulum on the Yucatan

Peninsula I'm going to follow my guide

down this ladder and you might guess

what's in there

a beautiful cave with Crystal Clear

fresh

water there are countless caves like

this in this

region as you might would expect

sometimes the roof collapses forming a

large pit or

sinkhole here is one of these collapsed

caves or sink holes that's mostly dry at

the

bottom in Mexico the sink holes are

called

notes I'm near Tulum Mexico uh in this

underground uh Cave System that has all

this beautiful water it's considered one

of the world's largest underground

drainage systems here on the Yucatan

Peninsula there AR any rivers or any

surface drainage it's all

underground and it's completely cared

this carst topography and we have a

collapse here that we're able to walk

down into and see this beautiful water

in here these Cotes caves and passages

formed and are being formed by the

dissolution of limestone slightly acidic

rainwaters are a weak carbonic acid that

slowly but surely dissolves the

Limestone there's so many beautiful

caves and cenotes in Mexico and many of

them are interconnected some people

think nearly all of them are

interconnected in the relatively small

area I visited scuba divers have mapped

over 50 miles of connected

passageways hopefully many of you have

figured out why I've come here to Mexico

to show you these beautiful Cotes and

what they have to do with the bretch

deposits we see in the canyon walls of

Wyoming

when the ceilings and walls of caves

collapse it breaks up the rock into

small pieces relatively small pieces and

of course they're going to be very

angular here we see a very nice example

of all the broken rock on the floor of

this cot over time this rock could

become lithified and form a breta

geologists refer to this as a collapse

breta what we have observed in Mexico

could certainly explain the breta we've

seen in Canyon walls a layer of Bret

within Limestone deposits it seems to

fit but does it there are still some

issues to explore and how does this all

relate to Florida and its

future I think this map could be of help

it seems that both Florida and the

Yucatan have some similar features they

both have adjacent large platforms made

of limestone could it be that they

developed in the very same manner I

think a cross-section along this red

line would be helpful let's do it on the

Whiteboard and here we are the west side

of my sketch is here the east side is

over here uh this is a cross-sectional

view we're looking sideways I could put

my little tree here somewhere but uh let

me explain some of these features uh we

have basement rock uh with this dark

line here and these check marks to

represent basement rock and all the blue

with the vertical lines in here are

limestones of various ages in fact it

goes from the

Cretaceous about 145 million years ago

up through the myene about 5 million

years ago was when the vast majority of

this Limestone was

deposited and the area right here is

Florida uh this wiggly line here on

either side it represents the the sea

level modern day sea level and on either

side of Florida we have these platforms

out here that have been drowned there

was a rapid rise in sea level which

drowned these platforms so they're not

actively uh being deposited upon but uh

they build up primarily in the

Cretaceous and uh this thickness here I

mean it's a lot of limestone 5,000 ft of

limestone right here and you easily have

about half of that here sitting on top

of Florida on this basement High

underneath the State of Florida and with

the climate and geology of Florida we

said up for a worldclass aquafer which

exists under the State of Florida it's

referred to as the Floridian aquifer and

actually it extends to the north as well

of

Florida and wow what an aquafer it is

it's typically about 1,500 fet thick or

so and they pump about 1.5 billion

gallons of water a day from it if I drew

a cross-section like this across the

yukatan peninsula it would look very

similar to this the geology is very

similar there is one exception and

Florida especially in the Northern parts

of Florida there's a relatively thin

veneer of solic clastic sediments that

were Shed off the southern Appalachians

that came out across Florida when I say

solic clastic I'm talking about sediment

that is silica based uh like uh Shale

mudstones and and sandstones Etc back to

this aquifer now with all this fresh

water moving through these limestones we

know what happens I mean it's slightly

acidic it's dissolving the Limestone and

we have a good setup to have carlike

features develop across the State of

Florida indeed most of us are aware of

the sinkhole problem in Florida and the

destruction that it can cause it seems

to be in the news fairly often as in

Mexico there are beautiful water-filled

sink holes and over 700

Springs there are several hundred

terrestrial or dry caves and over 150

underwater caves and those are just the

ones that we know

about the Florida Geological Survey

maintains this map which shows all the

reported incidents of subsidence keep in

mind that this map doesn't show all the

ancient scars from subsidence this only

shows the Modern Problems reported I

think we need to understand carting

better so I made this sketch it's a

cross-sectional sketch at least the

upper part is I have my hand handy

little tree here and then down below is

a map view looking from Above Down onto

the ground uh so coming to here we have

Limestone of course and I've depicted

various caves and passageways in here

some of the caves have collapsed uh like

these into sink holes and others have

yet to collapse that they could get

bigger of course and collapse in the

future and then I have a cave at a lower

level there could be a series of these I

just put one that's full of water from

top to bottom these here might be have

water a third of the way up or some of

the caves could be dry depending on

where the water table is now water

tables can change Through Time geologic

time and often that's associated with

the sea level that's moving up and down

through time these solution passages can

form along bedding planes within the

rock or also along vertical fractures I

might put some vertical fractures in

here n vertical

bedding planes are horizontal and

there's more water that moves into those

areas and so you can create more

solution uh cavities along these

fractures and bedding planes more than

I've depicted here and another thing I

know you've noticed already is that I've

put in red this is critical because this

is uh these are the piles of broken up

angular rock as you have collapse occur

of course you're going to have large

amounts of it right underneath the sink

holes

but you could have very minor amounts in

here there's some collapsing although

the vast majority of it in uh is is from

dissolution in here not collapse and now

down to the map view uh these circles

simply represent the sink holes where we

have the collapsed the collapses occur

in Matt view looking down and I've put

them in here Rel relatively random and

size and spacing and that's not always

true there can be preferential patterns

inze to these sink holes but I've made

them random for this

discussion and wow we've got the

setup but I'm going to ask you a very

important question if you think back to

the canyon walls and what we observed

does it show this does this setup this

sketch explain

that I'm not sure that it does and

furthermore I hope you're staying

patient with me here uh but I I hope

you're starting to think myON myON what

do when are we going to come to the

future of Florida how was this all tie

together the canyons and and carting and

all that come to the future of Florida

let's move on what we observed was a

quite continuous layer of breta in fact

my observations of this distinctive

layer in this region is that it's very

laterally continuous at a more Regional

scale this Brees Zone has been traced

over an area of about 150 by 120 Mi the

distinctive red color we see in the

bretches zone comes from Waters that

percolated down through a red Iron rich

mudstone that lies on top of the

Limestone shown

here so no this doesn't explain it maybe

it explains it in part in fact it does

but it doesn't explain what we're seeing

an outcrop and I want to give you a

minute to think about well how could it

how how could this explain is there a

way to tweak this so to speak what

happens through time I think that's a

good way to think about it if we take

this through time and just keep time

rolling what's going to happen well it's

pretty straightforward isn't it you're

going to create more caves uh maybe this

one will collapse another big cave will

form here and it'll collapse Etc and it

just keeps going and in map view maybe

I'll collapse one here and then here

and here and here Etc and just keep

going and going and you keep timer

rolling it goes on and on and this map

view I've got here all these circles and

partial circles Etc are old uh collapses

that have collapsed down that's where

they collapsed and of course underneath

it you have this breta that has

developed all the collapsed material so

you have a quite large areas of of

collapsed materi material and that's

what we see in the canyon we don't see

many places that doesn't have this

collapsed breta and the red here are the

areas that never did collapse they're

pieces that remained uh

intact and these can be quite tall so uh

of course everything in the blue area

has dropped down relative to the red

because they stay high and some of these

can get quite tall if the water table's

really deep it all makes sense if I had

these caves really deep and everything

collapsed around well what's left could

be very tall and of course you have the

the short versions too and this is what

I would call a mature carse terrain and

we have wonderful examples of that that

we can

visit who could have imagined that the

simple process of dissolving Limestone

could produce such a beautiful terrain

this is along the Lee river in China

another beautiful example of a mature

cars Terrain in Papua New

Guinea depending on such variables as

climate sea level and time Florida could

look like any of these cars

terrains I find it rather fun to imagine

these various

scenarios wow what an inspiring place to

be and to think about all this history

I've really enjoyed making this video

and I hope you've enjoyed watching it

thank you for watching
