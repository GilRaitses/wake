these mountains hold numberless secrets

that reward us when we unlock them with

joy and

astonishment Clues are found everywhere

within their beautiful rugged Cliffs and

peaceful valleys that lead us to

unlocking these

secrets we revealed a history of over

100 forests that were entombed and

petrified we uncover the amazing events

that occurred where the beautiful

Yellowstone Lake

is we learned the dark history that led

to the formation of massive amounts of

this beautiful

Rock and surprisingly we come to

understand why the centers of ancient

volcanoes are where large numbers of

grizzly bears

congregate this is the second video of a

two-part series although not necessary I

recommend watching part one before this

video the Beautiful Yellowstone Lake

it's a bit windy here today bit cool now

waves crashing in I've been here oh

countless times so many times but it

never gets old I have so many good

memories here at Yellowstone Lake and

other part places within the park uh

it's just a wonderful place to be but

there's something about this Lake I want

to tell you about right behind me out in

the distance was a big strata of

volcano yeah a big strata volcano and I

know that there some of you will be

saying well yeah of course there's the

big cair of Yellowstone no this was a

much older volcano you know it was some

45 million years old or so and then the

big hot spot moved in right and about

630,000 years ago it obliterated when

that super volcano came in it

obliterated the m Mountain the the

strata volcano out here completely

obliterated it amazing amazing stuff I

hope you're wondering uh to yourself

well that is super cool way awesome but

I want you to wonder well how did

geologist know that how can you know

something existed that's no longer there

and as we go forward and learn more

about these volcanic deposits and strata

volcanoes and how they work you'll know

why it'll become pretty darn

clear it turns out the building

knowledge on these volcano also unlocks

the secret of the Grizzlies and other

amazing Treasures we find like petrified

trees this is going to be a fun

Journey let's start this adventure by

looking at some fascinating outcrops not

too far from Yellowstone National Park

along Highway

14 beautiful outcrop here now we've

already seen examples of what I call

megal Laars these mud flows with

gigantic blocks in them in the mountain

side but this is what's more typical

here on these absor

volcanoes uh lots of beautiful clas

encased in mud now if we look at the

contact here at the bottom it came in

over a tough aous Sandstone this Lahar

did and notice that this classs here are

smaller at the bottom and as you go up

they get bigger and bigger and then

there's some complications at the top

but this is very typical of lahars it's

rever uh referred to as inverse grading

where the grading of the class size is

the reverse of what you might would

expect like in River deposits looking at

the outcrop you can see several lahars

they're typically about four to 5T thick

it's not uncommon to find lahars

containing a mix of beautifully colored

volcanic

rock so many different types of volcanic

rock jumbled into this Lahar each with

their own

story as an example this very large Red

Rock broke off the volcano and was

transported within a Lahar down the

mountain to

here the red color comes comes from the

oxidation of iron which likely occurred

as a result of large volumes of steam

filtering through the

rock sometimes it's easy to become

mesmerized by the beauty of these

deposits and forget the utter

Devastation they cause we'll learn more

about this area in a

minute now another thing I want to point

out that's pretty darn interesting is

it's poorly sorted although there's a

general tendency for small class at the

bottom to larger at the top it doesn't

always occur that way by the way but if

you come up here where the larger class

are I can find tiny little class that

are like the size of a uh a bb or

something very small uh and then down in

here you can find the larger class so

they tend to be poorly sorted not

surprising when you think of all these

class these rocks and broken up volcanic

fragments uh floating in mud and yet

another thing I want to point out is the

class in here can be very angular the

angles on the edges can be sharp and

they have 90Â° angles Etc they just don't

look like they're very eroded there are

classs in here also that are pretty

rounded like this one that I put my hand

on here this particular Lahar has a mix

of angular class and ones that are

smoother now now I've got a question for

you to think about I love to do this as

you know why would you have some lahars

that have pretty much all angular class

and others that have very well-rounded

class can you think of

why now it turns out these types of

deposits these lahars are volumetrically

very significant here in the aboras in

these strata volcanoes and they are

elsewhere as well but they seem

particularly abundant here we're going

to see a lot more of these and get a

feel for how how important they really

are as I mentioned earlier there are a

lot of lahars associated with the

sunlight volcano let me show you what I

mean can you still see

me impressive is isn't it these two

light colored areas are intrusions of

dayite a rock composed primarily of plag

Cl and

quartz the erosional features Within

These deposits sure are

interesting I wonder how many individual

Lahar flows occurred to build up this

accumulation I'm just a tiny dot right

here an impressive Mountain isn't it but

it turns out there there is more than

this to see a whole lot

more I'm right here but too small to see

and this relatively thin sequence is

what we've been focusing

on there's an entire Mountain above it

of Lahar deposits

unbelievable this is hard to take in

isn't it especially when you consider

the tremendous amount of erosion that

has occurred in fact if we could see the

uneroded volcano in the distance poking

up through the clouds it would be three

times taller than what we observe here

furthermore lahars can be traced 30 mi

from the center of this ancient volcano

named the sunlight

volcano for a devastating example of

modern Lahar deposition that occurred in

1996 and 97 we can go to the island of

monserat in the West Indies this volcano

is much smaller about 1/5 the size of

the ancient sunlight volcano

Volo you can clearly see where large

volumes of lahars mixed with pyroclastic

flows

occurred pyroclastic flows are clouds of

hot gas mixed with volcanic material

that flow rapidly along the ground

although there are some deposits on the

steep sides of the volcano the vast

majority of deposition occurred on the

lower and distal

slopes the capital city of Plymouth

located in this area with about 4,000

residents was completely destroyed and

19 people lost their

lives here it's quite clear that the

lahars have built a relatively thick

fan-shaped accumulation of mud and rocks

with no evidence of them on the steeper

slopes of the

volcano as we see on Google Earth the

lahars flowed clear down to the ocean 3

miles here and four miles

here these lahars carried many volcanic

rocks within them of various

sizes notice the very large ones behind

the buildings and of course the

destruction is just

heartbreaking this relatively small

volcano that only Rises about 2,9 ft

above sea level sure caused a lot of

Destruction

returning to the mountains of lahars on

the flanks of the 48 milliony old

sunlight volcano I try to visualize the

seemingly numberless catastrophic

volcano eruptions and Lahar flows that

devastated animal and plant

life with the background we now have

this double window is even more

interesting and it's so beautiful at

multiple

levels I think you can understand me

when I say I could could spend hours

investigating and contemplating The

Marvelous history written in these

rocks it's time to visit one of my

favorite areas of the absor mountains

the northern regions of Yellowstone

National Park this lava flow with its

columna joining is astoundingly

beautiful and it's part of the absor

complex not the Yellowstone super

volcano the high grasslands and Open

Spaces are typical of the aboras here

it's critical habitat for bison elk and

other

animals I've come to these Highlands to

explore an area I've never been to and

I'm looking forward to

it well I finally made it to where I

want to be and to show you what I want

to show you uh what a tricky place to

get to and it's quite a hike I mean it's

Steep and I ended up overshooting I I

went up another 400 feet clear to the

top of the mountain uh more than I

needed to I don't need to do that it's a

killer hike at least for me already I

got up there and I thought oh boy I had

some general ideas where to go but

specifically no and I thought I'm just

going to uh call my friend Sean wiy he

knows where it is and he has his own

geology YouTube channel really nice

Channel if you really want to learn more

geology check him out but he helped me

out and here I am let me show

you so here we go huh wonderful

beautiful love

it this is sure a big petrified

tree

wow it's certainly Mak an impression on

me I've never been here before I've

wanted to come here many many years ago

I I learned about them and finally I

make

it a magical place really impressive as

I hiked over to he and saw these upright

trees these petrified trees boy it

caught my imagination and immediately my

mind was going to what have these things

witnessed these trees these poor trees

these were able to survive upright you

know they didn't get pushed over like so

many but don't you wish you could just

see what these trees witnessed the great

strata of volcanoes

erupting ash clouds Lar cars coming

their way unfortunately eventually uh

covering them and killing all these

forests off and speaking of forests it

turns out on this mountain side they've

identified 27 different layers one on

top of another uh of these petrified

trees so we know there were at least

that many forests healthy forests that

grew were destroyed and a new cycle

started

and it turns out there are many of these

petrified forests scattered all

throughout the uh the aboras uh I know

of at least 10 or even more of these

forests and there are a lot of others

just individual trees or small pockets

of them scattered all through the this

volcanic

complex just really

amazing as I put my hand on this

petrified tree I can't help but think of

everything that it's witnessed the full

geologic history and to be covered for

millions and millions of years and

relatively recently to see the light of

day

again that's a lot to think

about these Lahar deposits are direct

evidence of the catastrophe that these

stately trees

faced at one time they were completely

enveloped by this rock which has now

been eroded away to reveal their

enduring

Beauty in 1898 John mure considered by

many to be the father of our national

park system visited this fossil forest

and wrote in part beneath living trees

the edges of petrified forests are

exposed to view standing on Ledges tier

above tier where they grew solemnly

silent and rigid crystalin Beauty after

swaying in the in thousands of centuries

ago opening marvelous views back into

the years and climates and life of the

past time exploring the area I found

many petrified logs and stumps at

various levels all the ones I saw were

encased in lar deposits like this large

tree on its

side all of them have been replaced by

silica and most of them had amazing

details preserved growth rings were

easily visible and beautiful to behold

even the cell structure has been

petrified geologists can cut and polish

rock into very thin slices and examine

it under a microscope and in the case of

these solici trees they are beautiful to

behold not surprisingly each wood has a

characteristic look and therefore easily

identified some of the trees uh

recognize include Redwood Pine Sycamore

and Oak the Magnificent specimen we saw

earlier is a

redwood here's a map showing the

locations of nine of the major fossil

forests in the absor volcanic field and

there are many many more less

significant localities keep in mind that

most forests have multiple levels for

instance the locality we visited has 27

this one has at least 31 levels and this

one has 48 I imagine that there are at

least a couple hundred of individual

fossilized forests within the absor is

incredible isn't

[Music]

it you know when I saw this outcrop in

the distance

I thought I know what that is you know

this thick section of light colored Rock

and I know you know what it was too just

from the distance because we've become

familiar with what volcanic ash looks

like it's a light color and we're in a

volcanic Province so surely it's

volcanic ash so the evidence indicates

that this volcanic ash was reworked by a

river system Geist refer to it as a

fluvial tough

how far away from the volcano do you

think these sediments were

deposited note that these tough deposits

sit on top of the trachyandesite lava

flows that we were introduced to in the

prior video it's a great marker

bed in the distance you can see the full

thickness of these deposits which is

about 200 ft and it carries on down the

mountain for some distance I was able to

trace this tough deposit over an area of

at least 15x 25 mil 200 ft of reworked

Ash that's amazing to think about let's

go to the top of this mountain to make

some

observations here I am walking along the

edge these are some tall Cliffs and The

Rock looks so different from any that

we've

seen in the flat area at the very base

of this section we see hints of the

fluvial tough that we are familiar with

I think we can divide this cliff into

two basic parts the lower half or so

seems to be moderately organized I see

some evidence of layering but not a lot

whereas the upper part looks to be

highly organized with lot lots of

layering clearly

visible the upper organized deposits

have a tendency to weather into

beautiful spires and

walls a closer examination of these

deposits indicate that they have a mix

of tough Lake and mudrich Lahar deposits

all indicating deposition far away from

the

volcano I was able to see at least part

of the lower section in add different

part of the mountain and what I saw was

rather surprising we see our

trachyandesite lava flows and then above

that our fluvial tough covered by rocks

and grasses and weathering into a humiy

Terrain and then there's the interesting

spires which correlates to the lower

part of the Great Cliff we just visited

are you ready to have some geologic fun

it's always fun to try to think about

the processes that uh fit the

observations that you make and here is a

very interesting observation to be made

we have the ash deposits the tough

rework tough deposits go from the the

basalt below working its way up all the

way up to very near or maybe even at the

base of those big spires and those

spires are made of very coarse grain

material in lahars and River gravels big

cobbles and boulders within that and

those are high Energy deposits when I

say high energy I mean I mean it takes a

lot of energy to move these big cobbles

and

boulders and they came in right over

very low energy uh uh tough

deposits so a massive change here in in

environments of deposition from low

energy Ash material reworked Ash to high

energy how did that happen why did it

happen I'll give you some time to think

about that

one to summarize we have a thick section

of low energy fine grain fluvial tough

then a fascinating sequence of Lahar and

River cobbles that we just visited and

then the upper organized sequence of

mostly low energy distal deposits very

interesting and quite a puzzle to think

about time for the Whiteboard discussion

now I've sketched a rather simple Strat

of volcano here uh but I do want to

point out the ground level that it build

upon which would be this heavy green

line so underneath it or in this case

sedimentary rocks and the volcanic pile

we often call it a volcanic pile of

material building on top uh I do want to

say that uh this would be more of the

proximal area to the cone to the actual

Center the medial and then the distal

we've looked at lahars in the modern

analog of the monsurat the island of

monserat we saw that the lahars tended

to stay on the lower slopes and

potentially distal and we've seen in the

field uh for the sunlight volcano and

and in the absor that the lahars can get

quite distal but they're not going to

hang on these steep slopes because

they're fluid they're mud they can be

pretty thick but they're not going to

stay on these steep slopes and also we

saw in the field these uh River deposits

and layered Lake deposits and distal

aars they're all way out here distal

they're also for the most part very fine

grain so there's this basic principle

which makes a lot of sense when you

think about it on the steeper areas you

tend to see bigger uh classs big

boulders and cobbles and and things and

as you get out further and further

you're going to see more and more fine

material until you get weight distal it

can be very fine like we saw on this

fluvial tough coming back to the tough

an airfall ash in theory could be every

where right but on the steeper slopes

it's going to be washed away by rain uh

very quickly so again the toughs tend to

be medial to distal the the actual tough

deposits that are preserved to learn

what types of deposits dominate the

steep slopes of a strata volcano we can

go to Mount St Helen's Southern slopes

this series of obvious flow deposits are

not lahars but thick viscous silic Rich

flows called andesite lava they are so

thick they don't flow very far and tend

to stop on relatively steep

slopes a while back I asked you to think

about uh why you would have some lahars

with very angular sharp edged class

versus the rounded class let's think

about that a minute and we think about

the system I try to visualize what's

going on on volcanoes or around the

areas of volcanoes and of course you're

going to have natural Rivers just normal

Rivers coming off these big high

volcanoes like we have in the

aboras and those Rivers as you know you

get out along rivers that have these

beautiful cobbles and boulders and

everything in them these Mountain Rivers

they're all rounded the rivers round

those very quickly so we have rivers

that have these rounded cobbles and the

lahars coming off the volcano of course

are going to cross rivers maybe they're

going to go right down along the river

valley and pick up all these rounded

cobbles

so that explains the rounded cobbles and

the angular cobbles are just come from

the breaking up of the rock as the

volcano um explodes and swells and

breaks and all that that you've seen in

videos of of volcanoes the rock is is

freshly broken and and it's entrained in

the mud and comes down hence the the

very angular

class before we solve some puzzles

there's one last point I want to make

when we need to think of things through

time so these volcanoes if you think

about it through time they build up they

start small and get bigger and bigger

and then eventually they die out but so

i' I've sketched this one he's pretty

big but through time of course it can

get taller and taller and more and more

deposits coming out and building up uh

proximally medially and distally all

these deposits and that's why we have

such massive uh massively thick Lahar

deposits in this case of the sunlight

volcano it's just build up tremendous

layers of of lahars for me this is the

very funnest part is to think about the

puzzles how to sort things out the

observations we make and you have to

think about the whole system and in this

case if you'll recall the puzzle that I

brought up is the way out here dist

where we have these flui reworked Ash

deposits the fluvial tough way out here

200 ft and then what was right on top of

that these large Boulders and clasps a

thick section it was probably about 200

ft as well sitting on top of these

deposits just like that the world

changed let me at least put a vertical

line here to represent that I won't show

everything yet so 200 ft out here of

these high energy you know I like to use

that word High Energy deposits over

these low Energy deposits how could that

possibly happen well let me give you a

clue uh this is a volcanic system

there's more than one

volcano uh we've just sketched the one

so you have to think about the whole

absor system the complex uh let's put a

volcano in our mind out here over here

and not only that they don't all go at

the same time do they they work around

and in fact in this case the old ones

were in the north and they progressively

got younger as you go to the South and

then it's not just north south it's East

West so you've got to think all these

things through but to keep it simple

let's put a volcano over here now it has

its own deposits and it has its own High

Energy deposits and lo and behold that's

how you can do that have a volcano here

and it has these high energy uh lahars

and rivers with the big cobbles and

stuff and they're coming out this way

from this volcano over here depositing

out and the their distal deposits I

should put some out here would be out

out here onlapping we call it onlapping

the prior deposits of this volcano and

sometimes they can be going at the same

time and in that case they fill in

together and meet in the middle out here

and interner finger with each other and

and it's really fun if you see that in

outcrop which I have I've seen that at

times so that's really interesting isn't

it that's how we do that and then if you

really want to think about it you go

well wait a minute we could have a

volcano off in the distance over here

and it could bring in

deposits from that direction Etc and

build an overlap gell just sorted this

all out and they noticed that they could

group several volcanoes to the north the

very oldest ones it turns out that the

northern volcanoes are the oldest and

they progressively get younger as you

come to the South and they took those

volcanos to the north and grouped them

to the Washburn group they grouped all

the layers all the different volcanic

deposits and that's from out Washburn

and Yellowstone and those being the

oldest then this I've sketched here is

kind of diagrammatically the sunlight

group and it involves a few volcanoes as

well and it's a bit younger so these

deposits went out on top of and

interfingered with the older ones uh to

the north and and so those will call the

middle group and then to the southern we

have the thoroughfare group and they're

the very youngest and so they went out

on top of these so you kind of have all

these different overlapping

relationships that are fun to think

about and it makes you think about

certain situations for instance like the

petrified trees so the petrified trees

that we visited they were in the

Washburn group The Very oldest group and

there were 27 layers at least in that

just that one mountain side and there

are others that could be even younger

they're all part of several volcanoes

they're the oldest as I mentioned and

then as you come to the sunlight group

they have petrified trees as well and

they're out on top of those because

they're younger and I'll sketch them on

this side I don't have the north side

diagrammatically sketched I don't have

enough room but we have I'll put

vertical dark lines here all these

layers of petrified trees uh many many

easily 50 that that we know about and

I'm sure they're way more than that um

stacked up in this group and then you

have the thoroughfare group and they

have their own set of petrified forests

scattered throughout that region and so

they're over here and on these volcanic

deposits that came that on top of here

and so if you just in your mind think

about this there's we'll say a 100

layers or so of forest stacked up within

the Washburn group if you sorted it all

out and easily that in the and the

sunlight group and then the thoroughfare

group and you get the picture there are

hundreds of layers of these petrified

forests in this absor

complex now that's fun to think about

isn't it I think think we now have

enough knowledge to crack the code yeah

to crack the code as to how we know that

there was a strata of volcano where

Yellowstone light now resides and the

fun one why is it that Grizzlies go

around and sniffing out so to speak and

finding the very cores of these Strat

volcano now that's pretty interesting

with the knowledge of the expected

distribution of various types of

volcanic deposits and features

geologists have been able to identify at

least 12 major Strat of volcanoes within

the absor range as shown by the red dots

on this map they range in ages from

about 50.6 million years old in the

north down to 43.7 million years or so

to the South what an incredible complex

This truly

was with the knowledge we now have I

think we can understand how geologists

arrived at the conclusion that there was

a volcano

here as geologists studied the rocks of

this region they found deposits that are

medial to distal from an unknown volcano

to the West coupled with the knowledge

of the location of the Yellowstone

Caldera it became clear that this unseen

strata volcano had been destroyed by the

super volcano

wow a similar process occurred at Mount

Washburn the location of another strata

of volcano they found lahars and lava

flows sloping to the north but they

couldn't find any sloping to the South

it became clear that the super volcano

had destroyed the southern half of the

mount Washburn strata

volcano so what is it with Grizzlies

seeking out volcanoes it's rather

surprising to see so many Grizzlies in

the High Country over a 100 Grizzlies

were identified in a recent flight over

the region this group is making its way

across some large steeply dipping lava

flows which are an important clue to

this

mystery this is typical terrain that

they congregate

in these big boys are making their way

down a very steep taillor

slope this one's decided he wants to

take an afternoon nap you'd think he

could find a softer

bed it seems that everywhere you look

you see Grizzlies how how many do you

see

here a closer view reveals that there

are eight of

them what do you notice about the

terrain from a geological

perspective do you think we're close to

the center of a volcano or further

away I haven't seen any lahars here at

all but I have seen lava flows like

along this area and we also saw them

with the bears climbing around on them

this geology reminds me of what we we

saw in the first video in the core of

the sunlight volcano as we've learned

the core area is dominated by lava flows

and these lava rocks are very brittle

and prone to fracturing and frost

wedging which leads to the formation of

large taus piles of distinctive angular

pieces of

rock watching these Bears on the Tor

slopes one clearly sees that they are

digging within them for something

even the young ones get in on

it this is what they're after yes Mo the

common Miller moth also known as the

Army cutworm moth during Midsummer they

migrate from the Great Plains up to the

high Rocky Mountains seeking tus slopes

they spend their days in air pockets

among the rocks and at night they feed

on the nectar of Alpine plants

it's a lot of work for these Bears to

come up into the High Country and it's a

time when they are building up their fat

reserves surprisingly moths provide the

calories they are looking for it's hard

to believe but a bear can consume up to

40,000 or even more moths per

day it's pretty fun to think about

grizzly bears can find strata

volcanoes I'm sure that but many of you

that are familiar with strata volcanoes

are asking the question how is it that

there are strata volcanoes so far from

the West Coast in fact the absor strata

of volcanoes are about 700 mil away from

the coast this is much different than

the Strat of volcanoes we see elsewhere

in the world as an example Mount St

Helens Mount Adams and the other Strat

of volcanoes scattered along the west

coast are typically just over 100 miles

from the coast how can that be

a sketch of the standard subduction zone

that we're all familiar with where we

have an oceanic plate here uh diving

underneath the the crustal plate here

going down down down as of course as it

as it gets deeper and deeper it also

tends to be quite hydrous uh with that

water involved the melting occurs uh

that comes up and eventually forms a

classic strata volcano like we see on

the west coast so the scenario that I've

sketched up here which is far more

unusual I've zoomed out here so the

distance from the coastline to the

volcano is again like 700 miles way in

board here and I've put in blue the the

uh oceanic crust so instead of

immediately starting to dive under and

subduct under the continental plate it

rides along underneath for some distance

a great distance here before it finally

starts to turn down and subd

and of course similar processes occur

here as as they did over here where you

you get the melting Etc and create these

distinctive strata volcanoes now there

are some uh debates about some of the

processes occurring here and the reasons

Etc but that's beyond my area of

expertise the absor has hold so many

Secrets as an example this entire

Mountain slid out as part of a gigantic

Landslide at speeds of over 100

mph you can learn about it on a previous

video I

did these ancient volcanoes are

critically important for lots of

wildlife like big horn

sheep

elk and surprisingly Pronghorn antalope

graze their High plateaus

it's amazing to think that from profound

destruction that occurred we now have

such beauty to

enjoy sometimes I think this is a

metaphor for life we pass through

seemingly impossible trials yet with

Time new Beauty and enjoyment can come

into our

lives I can never get over how amazing

the history of this planet is I feel so

privileged to be able to go out look at

the Rock and read the history written

within them and I've especially enjoyed

making this video and I hope you've

enjoyed watching it thank you
