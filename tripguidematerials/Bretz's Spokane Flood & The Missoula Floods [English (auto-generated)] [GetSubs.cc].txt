thank

you thank you for being here tonight

everybody we're going to start with a

story and the story hopefully gets you

interested in this lecture tonight

here's the title Brett's Spokane

flood and the Missoula floods and

they're placed together this way on the

board for a

reason this is a Missoula floods lecture

but I have some semi- radical things to

share with you today tonight and they

aren't my radical ideas they're the

radical ideas of Jay Haren Bretz himself

a 100 years ago so my job is to add to

the Missoula flood story I don't want to

take anything away from the Missoula

flood story there's a lot of wonderful

research by many many geologists in the

last 50 years that holds up properly the

details of the Missoula flood story

that's all real it's all accurate it all

happened roughly 20,000 years ago

roughly

but Bretz was on to something a 100

years ago and I didn't know about it and

I want to share it with you tonight it's

something called the Spokane flood which

is tied to something called the Spokane

ice sheet so the story the story happens

in Grand

culi 3 years ago May of

2021 and I had arranged to meet with a

geologist at Steamboat Rock so we're

north of Dry Falls in this beautiful

Canyon called Grand

culie and oh sure enough there's a

little Prius I guess that's the

geologist I guess I'm going to meet them

there on the side of the

road and we say well what do you want to

do here and the geologist says I want to

take a walk I want to take you and show

you some of these sedimentary layers

that are in the floor that carpet the

floor of grand a beautiful spring

morning we're chatting this is a guy

that's about 10 years older than I am

and we start talking about his career

with the

USGS and he starts talking about his

first assignment in the early 1980s when

he's up north of the grand north

of grand kolie dam north of Steamboat

Rock and he was assigned to make bedrock

geologic maps granits and things like

that but he got real interested in these

chalky white sedimentary layers in the

San poil River Valley North of grand kie

Dam similar to these chalky white layers

that are in the Floor of grand couie so

I thought oh with Brian Atwater he's the

best he's going to tell me all sorts of

details about those chalky white layers

in the floor of the grand and

that's what we did you might know that

name Brian Atwater this is the same guy

that a couple years later in the mid1

1980s was in a canoe on the Washington

coast found tsunami sediment layers in a

place that they shouldn't be in these

title mud flats and he single-handedly

changed our view of earthquake risk in

the state of Washington in fact the

Pacific Northwest Cascadia tsunami stuff

that's him that's the guy but he was

back in Eastern Washington to scout for

a field trip and he invited me along

okay here's the point of the

story we're digging we're looking he's

saying hey Nick there's a diami down

here there's a glacial till deposit in

the Floor of Gran culie and I'm like oh

I didn't know that was here that's kind

of interesting and he says well here's

what varves look like and here's how you

can count annual layers with between

events and the events here are the

Missoula floods coming right into the

floor uh and filling part of grand

 and there's other features that I

don't think I totally understand and so

here's Brian at waterers what do I think

so we're going back and forth it was

just the most Pleasant morning and my

brain was working real

hard but as is common for me I started

to get confused was lunchtime you know

for some reason I got no problem just

saying out loud I'm confused I'm getting

confused I can't keep these events and

straight saying that the glacial ice was

in the in the kolie but then there's

Missoula floods coming into the kolie

and then there's glacial Lake Colombia

that's in the coie and why is there a

 I just stopped and I I just

basically sat down and said I I can't do

this so here's a kind guy who

said well it is complicated Nick don't

don't be too hard on

yourself you know the simplest

explanation is to realize that there's a

decent chance that the grand kolie was

carved long

before these Missoula flood

sediments now I've been teaching about

the Missoula floods for 35 years and I

had never heard a statement like that

and so I said can you please repeat

that it's

possible that the kie was excavated and

totally formed long before 20 ,000 years

ago and he said I said who else is

saying that I've never heard that he

said well that you've heard of J Harem

bretts yes you've heard of Richard

Foster Flint yeah bitter enemies right

what what about them he said that's the

only thing those guys could agree

on that the was Far older than

the sediments that lay in the

floor so from that moment on that was a

gift that Brian Atwater gave me it was a

gift to see the channeled scablands in a

completely new way because I'm not just

thinking about 20,000 years ago I'm

thinking about a much older chapter that

is

plausible and that's what we're doing

tonight we're going back and forth

between Jay harand bretz's proposal a

100 years ago that there was something

called the Spokane flood that happened

long before the Missoula floods

and if that doesn't seal the deal I can

tell it did by the way the energy is

perfect now right in the room thank

you but just in case it didn't seal the

deal Brett's not only had an older

bigger flood event in his papers year

after

year but he had a different source of

water he had water coming from a

completely different place than glacial

Lake

Missoula so I don't think most of us in

this room have heard this story and it's

worth some time to explore bretz's idea

not mine Brett's idea okay I got

chalkboards that was the hook let's get

going let me tell the Missoula flood

story a 20,000 year old story as quickly

as possible and this is a PR glacial

Story the way that it's I can do this

with my eyes closed man I've been doing

this in my classroom for 30 years I

won't do it with my eyes closed but I

could and I'm going to use red red

tonight is going to be our Missoula time

our last glacial maximum time and this

is the margin of the ice sheet that's

familiar to almost everyone in the room

you've seen maps of the Ice Age floods

on a map this is the ice sheet over

Seattle not over Spokane uh down to San

Point Idaho and so on this goes all the

way to the east

coast 20,000 years ago Missoula floods

ready begin I'm going to do this in less

than 10 minutes time me okay

once upon a time there was an ice sheet

crossing the border 20,000 years ago

down from Canada it Advanced to a point

where there was a glacial Lake that

formed at Missoula Montana ponded water

trapped in The Valleys of Western

Montana why well there was an ice sheet

advaned that went down into northern

Idaho and that ice

sheet came over Sandpoint

Idaho that's the famous ice dam

you can eventually get too much water in

glacial Lake Missoula you're going to

burst through the ice dam in northern

Idaho and you're going to

release you're going to

release the water of glacial Lake

Missoula in about 48 Hours completely

drain this Lake in 48 hours and that

water screams over Eastern Washington

and it takes different paths and there

were dozens of Missoula floods all in

this vintage dozens of Missoula floods

some Biggers some smaller some floods

got into the cheni Poo tract south of uh

chinii Washington on its way down to poo

Falls and down to the Snake

River other floods got into the tord

crab Creek some floods got into the

grand

kolie some Missoula floods got into

Moses this is the conventional

story of the Missoula floods in

sometimes again in the neighborhood of

20,000 years ago the ice sheet was not

blocking the Columbia River at all and

if you drain the glacial Lake Missoula

it's going to follow the Spokane River

and the Columbia River all the way to

the Pacific Ocean but this water is all

getting through Wula Gap it's all coming

down the Columbia River Gorge this

Missoula flood water backs down to back

fills down to Eugene Oregon it goes out

to the Pacific Ocean and the coastline

of North America is further offshore

because sea level is lower 20,000 years

ago and so we eventually have a big pile

of sediment out here in the water called

the atoria fan and that's one event you

have multiple ice dams you have multiple

missula floods it's a proglacial story I

don't usually use that term but I'm

using it tonight proglacial means we are

doing this flooding out in front of the

ice sheet how do you like your flood

water if you're a Missoula flood water

you want your floods to happen under a

Starry Sky it's open air

flooding brown dirty water with big

icebergs floating in it those are the

blocks pieces of the ice dam itself from

northern Idaho that are floating in the

water carrying

erratics floating icebergs getting hung

up in the sides the whole thing every

drop of water is going through Wula

Gateway and getting to the Ator fan the

Pacific Ocean that's the Missoula flood

story included in the Missoula flood

Story the way that I taught it and I

didn't realize I was being incorrect but

there's a good chance now that I

am I was implying that there was no

Grand before 20,000 years ago not

just implying I think I was freaking

saying

it I saying if you can visit Eastern

Washington before the Missoula floods it

would have just been Rolling Hills from

the Cascades to the Rockies I I'm sure

I've got video program hell I've got

lectures in this in this downtown

lecture series that we're talking about

that

I'll keep them because they're mostly

accurate but the idea that we're

starting Grand cool Moses

Drumheller

channels from scratch 20,000 years

ago is probably not

correct if we look at this older work

talking about this older

time now let me I'm pausing because I'm

thinking of a few geologists who are

very well accomplished and they love the

fact that everything is red that you are

going to create the grand from

scratch using red chalk using 20,000

year old chock so we're already to an

open question and before I forget it uh

I'm not a researcher I don't have any

published papers that I'm trying to push

on people I'm a teacher from a few

blocks away I just like to ask questions

and I guess if I'm feeling particularly

bold I'm looking to inspire more work on

the Ice Age floods because there is a

the conventional wisdom that this has

all been figured out and if I'm totally

transparent I haven't done much with the

mulu floods in The Last 5 Years cuz I

was kind of bored with it I was just

saying the same thing over and over

again like I just did so that's the gift

that Atwater gave me a whole new door

opened up to this older work but it's an

open question among many is this

real and by the way bretts did nothing

but talk about the Spokane flood and

until January of

1927 and then suddenly after January of

1927 he starts talking about the

Missoula floods breads why did he change

his mind or did he change his mind or

did he just shift his Focus from his

older story to his younger story that

will be commented on as we go through

the

slides okay good so that's the

comfortable that's the conventional

that's the familiar

let's talk about Brett's idea I got a

surprise for

you and yeah it was noon today where I'm

texting Jerome Lesman from Vancouver

Island University and saying I need some

last minute help I'm

stuck I'm saying can you give me some

names of the well-known trenches in

British Columbia please like I should

know that but I don't so he gave me a

little sketch map that he did in between

classes and texted the photo to me and

I've got it I don't expect you to read

this this is this is chicken scratch for

me to remind

me okay first thing to mention Blue

tonight is our Spokane flood it's

older it's

bigger and it's older older

bigger the Missoula flood story is

younger and possibly

smaller probably smaller if you listen

to to this lecture

tonight so I want you to notice please

that this is a blue ice front this ice

sheet and this ice sheet are not the

same ice sheet right I'm giving you a

question mark date just for our

discussion tonight this is a question

mark I can't make it any bigger I can

yeah I can make it bigger look at me I

made it

bigger using Marine isotope stages and

using just a little bit of horse logic I

think our number that we're going to use

tonight for the Spokane flood is 150,000

years ago that's a lot older than 20,000

years ago and in newspaper clippings

collected by Sharon from Malaga over the

winter he was using numbers like 130 125

150,000 years ago Brett's was in

interviews with the Chicago Tribune Etc

but there's all sorts of dis differences

agreement with this date I'm just going

to use it for Simplicity tonight but we

could be as young as 30,000 years ago

for blue we could be old as a million

years ago I'm not kidding and we'll look

at some evidence for that before we go

but this is a younger smaller story this

is an older bigger story do you want it

let me get rid of the Missoula

floods and go to an older

time and put

in a little bit of the blue ice sheet

the Spokan ice

sheet so this brother the Spokane flood

is not a proglacial story what does

proglacial means it means we're having

flood waters out in front of the ice the

Missoula flood the red story is just

saying look the ice she's just a door

stop the Missoula flood story says the

ice is just sitting there and it's

deflecting water into that and

then that it's implying that the

ice sheet is like dry it's like dry ice

just sitting

there but bretz's idea for his Spokane

flood is that this Spokane Ice Sheet

which was older and advanced over the

city of Spokane and reached where

reached the heads of the flood channels

we're bringing an ice sheet and getting

it right we're putting it right into the

grand kolie we're putting the Spokane

ice sheet right into the heads of each

of these well-known flood

paths and what's Brett

saying Brett says the Spokan and flood

is a

subglacial

flow

story not proglacial

subglacial Bretz means we have water

coming directly from the Spokane Ice

Sheet it's not coming from a proglacial

lake by the way why is there a lake here

it's water from Canada coming out of the

ice

sheet but besides that point

Brett says can we please look at the

Spokane Ice Sheet 150,000 years ago it

got farther south than

Spokane and can we please address the

fact that we have these major north

south valleys called trenches in British

Columbia they are even present today

you've heard of the Rocky Mountain

trench the purcel trench these are

incredibly Arrow straight narrow valleys

that exist today and they are old they

are pre- I age they are gutters that

existed throughout the entire Ice

Age and drainage goes to the South

across the border these are gutters on a

house and there's a slight slope to the

gutters they're freaking coming right

for the state of

Washington and northern Idaho and

Northwestern Montana do you see where

I'm leading if Bretz wants a Spokane Ice

Sheet producing a Spokane flood we

probably are not talking about water

coming from Montana instead we are

having water traveling underneath the

ice and

flooding in specific

places where the trench where the gutter

is pointing to the edge of this Bane ice

sheet and so when Atwater says

what did he

say the simplest explanation is to have

the grand kolie completely carved before

the Missoula flood's time what he's

saying

is the walls of the grand cut

into balt are blue that's when we're

hauling all the Bedrock out to create

the

space and Bretz is saying that

aggressive major flood activity is water

coming down these

trenches is it an accident that the

Rocky Mountain trench heads right for

glacial Lake Missoula red was there a

blue glacial Lake Missoula do we have

any evidence for that 150,000 year old

65,000 years ago whatever the purcel

trench is heading right for Lake

pandere each of these major flood

Pathways the Okanagan trench in Cal in

Canada is heading right down the okaga

on our side of the border and heading

right down to shalan and wachi

Moses is right below the you get

the

idea so Bretz was obsessed with this

idea of a Spokane flood he didn't know

the

age but all of his Maps show that

Spokane ice sheet and again he never

switched to glacial Lake Missoula until

late in the 1920s even though he clearly

knew about glacial Lake

noula even when he started studying

geology I'll show you evidence for that

in a second I've got two more things I

want to do on the chalkboard the energy

is outstanding thank you so much for the

attention I'm loving this uh I'm pausing

also because I can't remember what's on

the back of this board but I it it'll

come it'll come to

me oh

fishes Patrick in the front row I will

not swear tonight Patrick you have my

solemn

vow can we say anything a little bit

more reasonable about the age age of the

Spokane flood there's two other

approaches that we can give this a try

and I'm going to grab some blue and some

red here we go come on boy you can do

this I went to a place called

Morango dinky little spot out in Eastern

Washington this past summer and I went

to Morango twice there's two separate

videos with field geologist Sky

from Montana took me out there first and

Bruce Bjorn dad from Tri Cities took me

out maybe a month later and this outcrop

has been studied by many it's an outcrop

that shows evidence for very old Ice Age

floods much older than red I'm going to

color this with red and blue chalk these

are train

tracks let's go from the top down to the

bottom this is a flood bed

evidence of the Missoula flood I'm using

red there's about a meter worth of rocks

mostly basaltic laid out in a line it's

an Evidence of an Ice Age flood coming

from glacial Lake Missoula and above

that flood bed is L wind blown silt that

was deposited since 20,000 years ago

we're

good but there is geology below that

it's not all Missoula in age at this

particular site and by the way there are

dozens of these kinds of sites scattered

throughout Eastern Washington dozens of

sites that show evidence of older than

red flooding ultimately getting to our

older than red flood action carving

coolies I hope you're not losing the

main point of the lecture down

here is a

much thicker bed of flood gravels bigger

blocks of

rock and that's a flood as well

but how old is old is this 150,000 years

old and the answer is no for sure not oh

really it's not it's older than so maybe

this is the Spokane flood it might be

how old might it

be older than 780,000 years ago for

sure possibly older than a million years

ago before I show you the evidence for

that are we saying the grand kolie

possibly was car a million years ago now

I'm not going to have many people

nodding their heads yes but I think it's

possible if we go to places like this so

before we leave the moringo site what

evidence do we have that this flood

event has to be older than

780,000 years

old two answers two answers the first

answer is these two things are calres

I didn't know much about calrs until

this past

summer calrs are buried

soils but they're thick buried soils

that have a crusty manner to them and

calrs as I have learned record hundreds

of thousands of years of time if you

have a thick well-developed concrete

buried soil you're not looking at a

Tuesday you're looking at hundreds of

thousands of years of time so if we have

two of those each representing hundreds

of thousands of years of time and we

have flood gravels below that were in

the neighborhood of a million years ago

that would be convincing enough but wait

there's

more the lose so this dotted here is L

this is lose this is lose this is L wind

blown Sil so the lus has been piling up

for more than a million years we know

this

but this particular lose layer which

sits directly above the flooded that's

older and bigger than the Missoula flood

bed has been studied

paleomagnetically

paleomagnetically

studied and if you study paleomagnetism

around the world you know that there was

a worldwide magnetic flip

at 780,000 years ago and before 780,000

years ago worldwide there was a reversed

magnetic polarity all the iron particles

of the planet in a freezing lava flow or

in sediment that's that falling in a l

stack are pointing to the magnetic South

Poles against a magnetic north pole so

these are reversed paleo mag signatures

in this event which tells us we've got

flood events below it we're suddenly

below that number of 780,000 years ago

finally before we go to the

slides oh man I drew right over my

ocean let me fix my ocean

here this is a boat in the ocean it's at

the Estoria

fan this is the atoria fan it's a

submarine fan

as I understand it I've never been out

there who

has Jo Joel giner

has as I understand it there's a huge

pile of

sand offshore under the waves of the

Pacific Ocean and all the field trips

I've LED there's always one question

that comes up maybe you've asked it

yourselves when you've been out to the

Eastern Washington scabs where did all

this rock go if it all got eroded away

that's a hell of a lot of rock sorry

Patrick it's the hell that's a lot of

rock where did it all go and it's a good

question and you can say well probably

just a few miles down the road where the

water the Missoula flood water slows

down and a bunch of those rocks settle

out and nobody likes that answer and

then you can say well probably the fines

the Sands and then the finer material

they got flushed all the way to the

ocean they like that answer and they're

like well where is it well there's this

pile of sand and finer material offshore

of atoria Oregon called The atoria Fan

again as I understand it the atoria fan

has only been drilled in one

place it's a big fan it's only been

drilled once according to Joel giner

from the University of Washington but

Joel is confident on that data even

though we have one data point you know

what I'm reaching

for red and

blue

sand that appears to be a direct deposit

from Ice Age floods Crossing Eastern

Washington

1ir of the sand in the drill Corp from

The atoria Fan One data point but

onethird of the pile of sand is

red is from the Missoula flood event

maybe a dozen Missoula floods maybe 90

Missoula floods it's representing

onethird of the sand pile in that one

drill Corp but there is a another

2/3 of sand

below and it's

blue it's

blue is it from the Spokane flood

singular is it Spokane floods earlier

than that multiple events we don't have

the data but it's not all Missoula sand

it's not all 20,000 year old sand in the

Historia fan that's new to me and

probably new to many of you well here he

is of course I had a camera going I told

the story like it was just the two of us

but I can't stop with my little iPhone

and my Gizmo so that that conversation

with atwat is available for you to watch

in

full and a drone shot of those beautiful

slackwater sediment layers in the Floor

of grand now Pop Quiz right now

it's not a pop quiz

just when you look at these familiar

looking photos

can I remind you that there's balt and

Steamboat Rock representing the old

 wall I'm seeing two different

Generations I'm seeing red and then blue

in the distance are you that's where the

new thoughts come in for me I'm seeing

this older erosion story and this

younger decorative story maybe the

Missoula floods are just bringing in

these decorations and not doing the

major digging Maybe

yeah so the level of detail preserved in

these red sediments you know what I mean

Missoula flood sediments and vves and

everything else meticulous work but

maybe not the whole story keep it going

boy so this is what I did this winter I

kept going back to this slide I tried to

do that on the chalkboards we're doing

it again here is the major erosion of

the coolies and scabland channels an

older story an erosive story a blue

story

Dory

yeah even something like this this is

the same coolu this is Grand but

we're Downstream now we're near the

great blade we're south of Dry Falls we

have the same bottom carved in

balt but now we don't have glacial Lake

sediments carpeting the floor sorry

about

that huge potholes drilled in and a blue

truck right at Dry Falls

when did we do the digging I know that's

a lot of

water is it Missoula flood water from

glacial Lake Missoula carving that or is

it Bret's Canadian water crossing the

border subglacially and doing the

carving that's a radical change in a

radical addition to the

story so using the Sharpie markers here

was my attempt this winter to show The

Trenches I didn't know the names then I

made them up and here's the path ways

the channeled scab lands that were

reused by the Missoula

floods but not carved by the Missoula

floods according to

bretts this is what I got from Jerome

Lesman a few hours ago over the phone

texted me this map I've seen it before

but I didn't have one handy look at what

we're looking at this is the Canadian

ice sheet over the province of British

Columbia it's transparent we're looking

through the ice and whether we're

looking through Red Ice ice 20,000 years

ago or blue ice 150,000 years ago or a

milliony old ice if there was a million

year old

glaciation can we see the trenches can

we see the

gutters this water has to be crossing

the

border during the Ice Age flooding

time got this from Sky just a few

hours ago as well same idea

idea I'm sorry to say but I think the

American story has been so preoccupied

with taking water from Montana and

having a proglacial story that nobody's

even thinking about the Canadian

version it's just a it's just a

political border can we get rid of that

line

please Round of

Applause can't we all get along that's

just kidding

stupid so Sky used is red but he could

use blue as well he could use purple he

could use any color he wants from

different Generations during the Ice Age

okay we've got

it so even animations at Dry Falls where

we bring water in this is a animation we

spent a lot of money on and many people

like it but some would email me and say

well you know that the wasn't

there before the Missoula floods and

you're showing a cut already

before the Missoula floods and I'm I

think I want to email each of those

people saved all flagged all their

emails say check this out now we have

idea that it's an older bigger

story and that this is okay to have this

water or maybe this is the volume of

Missoula water so here's another

point if we're carving the floor of

grand culie down to its level that we

have today early in the story that's a

low

elevation and so if we're bringing

Missoula water in Young

it's going to be heading to Grand

Grand is going to

siphon much of the water compared to the

other flood paths that's another way to

look at this in a different manner of

course I have to include this everybody

loves this yes it's water coming down

the grand

coolly it's more than a simple

waterfall and we were conservative with

this animation we could have put a

thicker column of water based on what

bretts was pointing out so the Spokane

flood is for sure an older bigger story

that Brett's was hammering from 1922 to

1927 and yet compatible with that if we

realize there's a much younger story we

can do this red thing from Dan Co and

this is what I did right straight away

at the beginning of this lecture looking

at the Missoula floods proglacial

floods we're we're not doing flooding

under the ice we're doing flooding out

in front of the

ice all the way to the atoria

fan this is an animation put together by

the USGS showing the speed at which

we're draining glacial Lake Missoula red

water thank you perfect and draining

across Eastern Washington and getting

held up at Wula gap before that water

goes down to the Columbia River Gorge if

we go to glacial Lake Missoula itself

there's the high water Mark I'm going

quickly because this has been talked

about a million times by me and others

if you're new to the concept of the

Missoula floods I'm sorry this is going

to be frustratingly fast but there's

faint shorelines marking the high water

mark of glacial Lake Missoula above the

University of Montana there are

different shorelines how many lakes are

we talking about it's hard to say nobody

knows might just be one lake with

different levels of draining but Pari in

1920 in 1910 Joseph Pare was the first

to document not only the fact that we

had a sorry that's incorrect Joseph

party was not the first to document that

glacial Lake Missoula

existed he was the first to publish on

these incredible giant current ripples

that are on the floor of that former

glacial Lake Missoula Tom Foster photo

here these currents grab everybody's

attention of course the scale is

enormous there's really two debates

we're talking about and the debate

between bretts and his critics before

1960 was whether there really were huge

volumes of Ice Age flood water that div

that debate is done Brett was absolutely

correct and everyone everyone in geology

agrees these outrageous floods of water

happened but there's now a new debate

based on a very old debate about the age

of the floods and the source of the

water so Pari is a major part of our

story tonight but he didn't invent

glacial Lake Missoula and there's an

interesting angle on this these are the

two guys that first noticed glacial Lake

Missoula in the

1880s they were from Southern Wisconsin

and worked their way west and made note

in a 19 in an 1885 publication for these

faint watermarks on the shoreline here's

Chamberlain's paper first making a note

of this this paper is available to as

well as many others I'll tell you about

that at the end of the lecture

tonight A University of Wisconsin

student went out in 1895 started taking

photos of the shorelines of glacial Lake

Missoula I mean bretts hasn't even gone

to college yet and these things are

being

published Campbell in 1915 making a

guide book he's making like a modern

looking map of glacial Lake Missoula and

the ice sheet so you're hearing my point

why wasn't Brett's talking about glacial

Lake Missoula when he first started

publishing on the Ice Age floods in

Eastern Washington I have an answer I

don't know if you like it it was the

wrong source of water for what he was

mapping he was mapping channels coming

away from a Spokane ice sheet that

didn't work with this glacial Lake

Missoula story and he knew there were

two different generations of ice and

therefore two different generations of

water

this is Alden and Joseph

Pari back in Western Montana these are

some old blue till deposits of the

mission marine and red glacial Lake

Missoula floor sediments on top older

bigger down below younger smaller up on

Top in Missoula we've got all sorts of

beautiful things at 9mile I got a chance

to visit with all the folks who know the

the best things about each of these

aspects of the story Larry Smith has

done a whole career's worth of research

in the Floor of glacial Lake Missoula

and yes our dates for the Missoula beds

and the Missoula floods are in the

neighborhood of 20,000 years ago if you

look more carefully it's about 19,000

down to about 15,000 calendar years

ago dates coming from uh surface

exposure dates all sorts of postglacial

dates we have a firm grasp on the ice

sheet story and the Missoula flood story

from the Missoula time red glacial Lake

Missoula this not colored pencil time

and this is taking a map from the 1960s

and putting in the blue ice where it was

mapped in the 1960s keep it going so we

have this story but is it an older story

as well can we do this same kind of look

with an older Source it can't be glacial

Lake Missoula or Ken it

if we're still in Missoula time we're

ponding the water abruptly at Wula Gap

because it's too narrow to go through

the Wula Gap and so interviewing people

who have Native

American uh treasured stories about a

time when the lower Yakama was flooded

is an important source of information

going to places where the bonnaville

flood is entering the scene and having

Missoula floods above to get some

relative age dating so talk to Wilsey

from College of Southern Idaho about the

bonnaville flood Berling game Canyon

look at these repetitive chalky bites

this is still red now this is still

Missoula flood time and this is where

all our good age control and detail is

coming from but this is even though this

is massive and

impressive it's still the younger

smaller story according to this lecture

tonight there's one precious Ash bed

that's been dated at 16,300 years ago

from Mount St Helens which helps us keep

track of time Richard we is well known

as being a master of those slackwater

sediment beds and he enjoyed me this

winter as well lots of different

perspectives on this story but we're

here right we're here with the Missoula

floods we're trying to expand our mind

and ask ourselves a place like pooo

River Canyon which also had massive Ice

Age

floods are those Miss the

floods are they

older poo

Falls the river is nothing special it's

the canyon that's special it's a flood

cut

Canyon older than 30,000 years ago older

100,000 years

ago difficult for us to

say Brett did his mapping this is a

Brett's map from the

1920s and he also knew a lot of geology

in the Columbia River

Gorge Jim Conor a well-known Columbia

River gour

geologist thickens the plot a little bit

for

us Jim o Conor was open to the entire

Series this winter he watched every

episode and he

participated but he firmly but nicely

said I got no Spokane flood deposits in

the Columbia River

Gorge I'm open but I know that Gorge

pretty well and there's no deposits that

I can see that are from this Brett's

Spokane

flood and so in the Columbia River Gorge

according to OK Conor he's got nothing

but Missoula flood deposits Downstream

of Wula Gap and the Spokane flood and

all of these older floods going back a

million years remember Morango and our

big flood that was older than 780,000

years ago that water had to go through

the Columbia River

Gorge OK Conor doesn't see any evidence

of any of that so that's almost arguing

the other way around that the Missoula

floods were the youngest and the biggest

and they flushed everything else out

that was older that had to have been

there but there we did have another

Columbia River gourd

show and we talked to Scott Burns who

was wearing a blue shirt

interesting and Scott burn says I know

of some spots in the Columbia River

Gorge not far from the Dells and I do

have older dates than 20,000 years ago

they're just up a little

higher and away from The Gorge itself so

is there more research that can be done

in the Columbia Gorge up high into the

sides of the Missoula flood pathway

between Wula Gap and the ocean to me

this is another place that is ripe for a

bunch more work if we can just get some

young excited professors and graduate

students and other professionals

involved in the story so so Scott Burns

says I got

both but that's just one set of grad

students under the tutelage of Scott

Burns from Portland State University

even a map like this this black stuff is

where the floods have eroded the Bedrock

including Grand are you looking

at it differently now I am that's red

ice coming in but is the Red Ice

encroaching into a bunch of coolies that

are already there are there buried are

there

buried

coolies north of where we see them

buried under what buried under Missoula

flood sediments that's another open

question can't we do a bunch of seismic

profiling or geophysical work somehow to

map out the northward continuation of

these coolies and if they connect

farther and farther

north that's a bigger and bigger case

for a older and bigger story okay to

bretts we go and bretts has all sorts of

timeline stuff that helps again us

realize that he's not just making stuff

up Brett's did work in Puget Sound for

four years as a high school teacher

talked about that last night bretts then

got a teaching job at the University of

Chicago he spent a Solid 5 years in the

Columbia River Gorge making a case for

some sort of Crazy Event coming through

that Gorge before he finally arrived at

his very

famous Ice Age flood research Spokane

flood in Eastern Washington so this is

downtown Seattle Brett cuts his teeth on

what glacial drift looks like in Puget

Loland he's a high school teacher we did

this last night Bretz has got his

students out looking at all this he's

documenting all this glacial deposits

before they go away completely because

the hills were washed into the Puget

Loland the Puget Sound this is the

publication that summarizes breard

Western Washington work when he was a

high school teacher there's a famous

story that Brett's just devoured

anything he could get his hands on this

before the internet right so he's going

to the library every week any new

Publications any new

Publications and The Story Goes that

Brett's found this brand new topographic

map from

1910 from a place in Eastern Washington

that was just surveyed the previous

summer and the name of the quadrangle is

the Quincy quadrangle and the feature

that caught Brett's eye is the place

that the map makers called the

Pooles and part of the reason that

Brett's left the University of

Washington after being a teacher there

for one year as a faculty member is he

said I kept taking this map to all

everybody that I taught with and I said

can you believe this what's your

explanation for this let's let's

brainstorm about this they're like yeah

I don't know rivers or something I guess

he's how can you not be fascinated by by

this we've got two horseshoe shaped

Cliffs and Brett is turning the thing

sideways and then we now have the luxury

of being able to see this from the air

and we can see that this is not a simple

River story that this is an outrageous

flood story and this winter I got help

from the viewers about where Rail lines

were at certain years and this is a 1910

map and Bretz and his wife living in

Seattle must have been going by train

back home to Michigan for the holidays

at least and the black dot is where the

potholes is and he's within a

Stones Throw of the Quincy Railroad

Station he must have just he was so

obsessed with the potholes he must have

shot over there some point to check it

out but as The Story Goes he didn't

until

1922 never never were able to find

evidence that bretts got to the potholes

coie before then so he joins The Faculty

starts in 1915 and goes all the way to

1947 that's quite a long career teaching

every year at the University of

Chicago and it's that time that he

started taking graduate students back

out to the Pacific Northwest for a few

weeks every summer it's a field course

training grad students to become

geologists and his first few Summers he

decided Well I know the Seattle area let

me head south and take my first couple

of batches of University of Chicago grad

students south of there and let me look

look at the gravels that are in the the

the chahalis river where we're draining

water away from the margin of the Puget

ice

sheet and so he's hovering and he's on

foot and they're hopping trains even

stage coaches and they're going PL and

chahalis and down to Aberdine and

they're thinking about water whether

it's subglacial or not coming off of the

ice sheet sitting above

Seattle and I visited with Kelsey

Stanton who just finished up a PhD at

the University of of

Washington and she shared some of her

new

data and by God in the shahis Kelsey

just satisfied much of our curiosity

that she has an inset geology coming

down the chahalis river

valley younger smaller older bigger set

like that and she's got dates that are

much older than the Missoula

floods it continues though then Bret

decided Well I'll just go all the way

cuz I'm starting to find these golden

courtz sites in the satum that don't

belong they must have come from Eastern

Washington so he starts following these

golden Courtside

breadcrumbs Eastward up River and so now

Brett's every summer is bringing his

students out to the Columbia River Gorge

doesn't have a car yet we're in the late

we're pre-World War I they're coming out

on the train they're doing the fieldwork

by train they're walking a lot and

they're mapping the geology as they go

thanks to Karen from Malaga adding all

sorts of newspaper documents so

newspaper interviews with the students

and different batches of students coming

out student geologists in Oregon Country

September of

1919 Sharon thank you for your efforts

this entire winter with all of that work

great addition well guess who wrote the

first Roadside Geology book of the

Pacific Northwest as far as I can tell

published in 1915 I Williams is the lead

author but his right-hand man was Jay

Harland

bretts so there there's a brand new

highway the Columbia River Highway going

through all this beautiful old Bedrock

but Bretz is also thinking about the

pine and the pine as well and this

exciting New Road is getting many

regular folks like you and I out to some

of these spots and thinking about

geology in 1915 the thing sold out

immediately apparently Roadside Geology

more than 100 years ago thanks to the

viewers for all these photos Tom Foster

for some of these photos if you're

unaware the Columbia River Gorge is

heavily scoured in the bottom half of

the walls and Untouched by the floods

whether they Missoula floods or Spokan

flood higher

up so this is a whole another part of

the Brett story that's often overlooked

he was able to piece a lot of these

relationships together as he's literally

getting closer and closer closer to the

channed scab lends of Eastern

Washington beautiful old paintings

colorized paintings more recently by

viewers thank you for adding this color

to this

presentation put in too many of

these the last summer in the Columbia

River Gorge one of the 19-year-old

students at the University of Chicago

learning from Brett

turned out to be his bitter enemy later

in life Richard Foster Flint so there's

an interesting totally

unresolved in our minds relationship

between Brett and Flint but they climbed

Mount Adams together in

1921 and shortly after Brett started

publishing Flint taught at Yale one of

his students was Steven Porter Steven

Porter had a full career as a glacial

geologist at the University of

Washington one of Porter's students was

Richard

weight who went to the uh um and this

lineage continues to

today so there's a direct lineage from

who I'm dealing with these days back to

these oldtimers that we all know back to

the Joseph parie story The Story Goes he

was invited by a local Spokane teacher

called Thomas large and he invited both

bretts and Pari to Spokane to improve

Thomas large's teaching game in this

brand new col uh High School where he

taught but Jim o' Conor who I mentioned

before who doesn't have the Spokane

stuff down in the gorge was a loyal

viewer and he got interested enough to

start requesting old

notebooks in addition to the Brett's

notebooks that we were able to get for

the series and so since session Z in

mid-February Jim ooc Conor has been

going through the Joseph Pari notebooks

and there is a major change in that part

of the Missoula flood story as opposed

to party just showing up in 1921 or 1922

and seeing a few things and giving a few

notes to Thomas large the high school

teacher by looking at these notebooks

now party was everywhere in the

19 no surprise there many of his

Publications getting into the channeled

scab lands but not a lot of major

emphasis on the on the channeled scab

lands themselves and what they mean but

here's what o Conor just in the last

couple of months has been able to unbox

and

enjoy handwritten notes from October of

1920 this is 2 years before large

supposedly invites Pari to come and look

at this bucan area and Pari is writing

about water and the

scabs he's beating bretts to the punch

in his

notebooks and he keeps going the thought

was Pari was maybe working around this

spane area just a little bit and taking

all these notes but he's east of Spokane

but he's going way farther a field than

that and these notes continue scab Rock

glacial floods nobody's talking about

glacial floods supposedly in print until

Brett's first paper in

1923 not so according to this new

discovery so I introduced Glenn who's in

the crowd tonight from

Spokane Glenn immediately got on these

par notes plug them into Google Earth

and every one of these P's is where

Joseph Pare was pre bretz's arrival in


so party was seriously on to this story

and it maybe a question we will never

have answered is how much did Pari help

bretts with the story of the Missoula

floods or did somehow part's

notes get lent to large and then large

loan them to BR I don't know but there

there seems like there's kind of a

meeting of the minds with that sort of

work so par is even more of a player in

the Missoula flood story

few more slides and I think we're done

tonight more photos just to set the

stage for this days of Spokane so long

ago and here's the second summer that

Bretz is out and he's borrowing a car

from Thomas Lodge they still don't have

an automobile out there and thanks to

the Eugene team jod and others who I

told that story last night where we had

access to all of Thomas largest papers

we get jewels like this basically bretts

and saying I got to give you a quick

handwritten note I'm sorry we screwed up

your Ford okay we're turning it back we

screwed it up uh please buy a new Ford

and tell me how much it costs and I'll

pay you back for what the new court so

they they they beat it to Hell sorry

Patrick so that's the Eugene Team all

those large beautiful notes and letters

coming from this collection and yes I

went to the live viewers over Christmas

time and just asked if anybody could

show up in Eugene Oregon to see those

papers and a whole group of people

strangers to each other showed up and

captured every last paper of the Thomas

large collection thanks again to Jody

Chris Lucy yasman John and than thank

you all these personalities and the

details add so much to the story

especially if it changes the narrative

or adds to our enjoyment in the Thomas

large collection are Originals of bretts

that apparently were then sent to the

printers to publish his first couple of

papers and how it got to large and large

kept kept them this is all Brett's

original notes there Thomas large the

high school teacher in Spokane is also

the guy that started a group called the

Northwest science Association scientific

Association they're still meeting

they'll be doing a meeting in Spokane in

May of this

year these original notebooks of Jay

Harland bretts were made available to us

as a learning community and they've been

posted on my website and so we have all

been diving deeply into all these

original things handwritten notes as

well as typed up notes from Brett's

starting in

1922 his Focus was on the Spokan flood

ladies and gentlemen no talk of Missoula

for those first five years I find that

fascinating and totally a

surprise and it's that Atwater story

that got me interested in this original

work by bretts viewers contributed

making custommade Maps trying to trace

where bretts was going by rail by

foot in the first field season and

Beyond Brett's got evidence that the ice

sheet the Spokane Ice Sheet got right

over Spokane and went parked directly at

the heads of each of these flood

channels making a case for subglacial

flow coming from an older

story this came in this morning from

Google Earth by Glenn who got up at 3:45

in his Ellensburg hotel and said I think

I have an idea I can take mapping that's

been done recently on state websites and

overlay Brett's blue line and sure

enough this pale yellow is the list

that's been mapped today and it abruptly

stops right where Brett's had it a 100

years ago modern mapping working

generally with the old master who didn't

even have topographic base maps for much

of his area he was using old surveying

methods more on that in a second this

keeps coming up this younger smaller

story lower in elevation this older

bigger story left high and dry on the

sides I may be high now I'm making this

up but I keep I think I think I keep

seeing this relationship over and over

and over again yeah this is a beautiful

map we'll talk more about tomorrow night

and the story behind drafting this

beautiful map from

1928 but there's Spokane and there's

this Spokane Ice

Sheet again in the first few Summers

Bretz only has this to measure

elevations over and over and over

again and to take that and make his own

topographic base map and then to put the

geology on top this also from Glenn and

Spokane here's a modern

image there's imagery from space in

Eastern

Washington there's Brett's

map using his hand and an

ometer look at

that that's Precision after a decade of

mapping one guy and a handful of grad

students

incredible so he had a split life he's

out here every summer at least in the

1920s doing field work pushing himself

real hard more than 300 of field days in

the

1920s and then the rest of the year

working hard every day at the University

of Chicago in 1925 he finally broke down

and bought a new car a Dodge

squareback and he was married to Fanny

and they had two children Rudolph and

Roda and in 1925 they drove out instead

of taking the train so Brett's figured

out how to get his student out here some

other way or maybe they rented a car or

something and so to hear directly from

Jay harand Brett's son Rudolph the guy

that was born in Seattle in that new

house again the viewer to community came

through and I got those old interviews

with Rudy got permission to post it so

you can listen to stories about driving

out to the channel scablands from

Brett's son Rudolph recorded back in


bretts and large go way back they

connect on many levels including being

fellow High School teachers beautiful

shots here and there this is the Poo

River

Canyon every summer Brett is going

someplace different this is 1925 he's

now North uhoh Brett is going north now

of Spokane why would he be doing that he

still loves the Spokane flood he's got

his Maps but now they're looking for the

source

every summer he's now looking for the

source of the water what could have

created so much water to flow

subglacially under this Spokane Ice

Sheet Brett's in 1925 I love I'm going

to read portions of this one I love this

one this is from bretts to large

December of 1925 this guy is high now

he's having the time of his life he's on

a wild goose chase to look for the

source of this Spokane flood dear th

this large dear large if I was in your

shoes this weekend or any weekend I

would most certainly move those shoes to

a certain place out of the Great

Northern a little north of the Spokane

quandre and I move them around a lot in

that region and after that I would come

back a great deal more content to stay

put for a while so what's it all about

why I'm trying to start telling you what

I found last summer and as soon as I

take up my typewriter to let you know

that I am well and hope that you are the

same I think of that intriguing area

that I didn't have time to finish and

that may hold the secret to the whole

blamed thing well to begin no volcano

found so he had in his mind there was a

volcanic eruption in Northern Washington

or across the border in British Columbia

a yokul up to melt prodigious amounts of

water at the base of the Spokane ice

sheet and have that be the source of

this Spokane flood he's reporting around

Christmas time to his old friend at the

Spokane high school next load up your

pipe with the fact that there are three

other notches similar to this cut across

the range so Brett is now saying I've

mapped north of Spokane the we're out of

the basalts and there's these strange

waterworn notches cut into these

Highlands it looks like major floods are

coming over the granates and the

metamorphic rocks north of Spokane I

think the water source is farther north

than that

I'm cutting now these notches are

typical of dozens of other throughout

Northern Washington within the limits

I've indicated but these are only the

ones I found beyond the limits of the

Wisconsin ice and all the others might

be claimed so he knows it's Spokane Ice

instead of Wisconsin ice the Red Ice to

do that what caused those notches they

are not found in Idaho to the east nor

the Cascades to the West nor the

glaciated highlands and mountains of New

England and New York so far as the maps

and the literature indic indate they are

all limited to the Highlands North of

the

scabs what caused them well what would

happen if a lava flow was squeezed out

like a ribbon flat on the brush or in

any other fashion beneath an ice sheet

this vcan I sheet somewhere up in the

headwaters of the Kettle River West of

the Arrow Lakes and east of the Okanagan

Lake if the good Lord permits I am going

into that country next summer and find

the place where the Extrusion occurred

according to rinek of the Canadian

Geological Survey the same features are

common in The Kettle River Valley and

according to the major physiographic

features of the Southern British

Columbia such a location would allow

subglacial streams to get as far west as

the lower

smiline and as far east as the

Ponderay large I may be all wrong I may

not I am not asserting but there is

something in this country that isn't

dreamed of in our ordinary philosophy of

glaciation

Horatio best regards Jay harand

bretts so that next summer he was in BC

exclusively on the hunt for lavas and I

did an episode with Jerome Lesman who

knows British Columbia geology well and

there ours some youthful basaltic fields

we don't have good dates on those

basalts yet there's another angle for

research is it worth trying to figure

out how many of these balt fields in

Eastern British Colombia are of the

right age to potentially produce water

for this Spokane flood so at the end of

that field season in December of

1926 Brett's presented an oral report at

the GSA meeting in Madison Wisconsin and

the title of is

inogram this is in the auditorium I took

English 101 by the way in

1982 kind of

fun uh Bretz was there TC Chamberlain

was there his son Rand Chamberlain was

there and here's the abstract that

Brett's presented what caused the

Spokane flood new data will be presented

on the distribution and character of

Channel scabland and associated travel

deposits on the Columbia Plateau they

indicate that the Spokane flood was an

even greater Affair than previously

thought studies in Washington and

British Columbia North of the scabland

strongly suggest that basaltic flows

which were extruded beneath the ice

sheet produced the great flood the field

has not yet been sufficiently studied to

justify a definitive affirmative the

paper is a report of progress in

following up on a promising clue okay

I've got you now

hang

on this guy is having a

blast he's going to continue for years

looking for the source of this bokane

flood but this is December late December

of

1926 and two weeks later he's in

Washington DC attending a meeting with

the USGS

geologists and it's a meeting that does

not go well he present presents to all

the USGS men in the room on the Spokane

flood and after a 2-hour

presentation there's silence and then

each USGS geologist stands up one at a

time and explains why that is completely

impossible and you cannot have any big

floods of water they have to be normal

glacial

rivers and he never goes back to British

Columbia he never goes back to the spok

can flood discoveries he shifts to the

Missoula flood

narrative now is that an accident or is

it strategy on his part because he's

just now trying to survive as a

professional and he doesn't want to be

the butt of everyone's jokes anymore and

he's giving up on the more outrageous

Spokane flood as a subal story and he's

leaning towards a known thing glacial

Lake Missoula

and for the rest of the 20s and Beyond

he's talking about glacial Lake Missoula

so this Cosmo club meeting in Washington

DC two weeks after that Madison

presentation is a major turning point

and not for the good and yet he doesn't

quit he doubles down all of his field

observations back to Eastern Washington

after being pissed off by that meeting

and go fighting through some depression

goes back and builds a case even longer

writes to large again talking about all

this new stuff you found they cannot

deny my story now says Jay harand

bretts more like more fun than I've ever

had before in haste

bretts so he's energized probably from a

negative point of view to prove the

bastards

wrong summer of 1928 more

double-checking and now going to the

margins of the scab Lance summer of 1929

has last last full field season out here

in the 20s he's going to glacial Lake

Missoula he's going to the Spokane area

and he's now preoccupied with Moses

kulie the Columbia Valley south of

Chalan down south of

wachi we're going to skip some of this

but the point is glacial Lake Missoula

is now a major part of his writing the

final culminating piece of evidence by

which the Spokan flood hypothesis will

stand through all the storm terms of

criticism yeah even his writing is now

talking directly to his critics as

opposed to a general audience it's a

fascinating change in demeanor in

writing we finished tonight with a

little bit of aota with some more

discoveries from the viewers so Flint

never did agree that there were

outrageous floods of water whether it's

Missoula or older he never bought it

even though he was a former student of

britz and he published paper after paper

in the 1930 a ing this idea of

outrageous floods of

water but from the archives at the

University of Chicago this note

frustratingly with no

date is Dick Flint writing a note to

Brett saying

congratulations they say seeing is

believing some can believe without

seeing and

bretts but he

reversed so I don't know are you a

detective I don't know at what point

that would have been

written but Flint never gave up his

criticism of these Missoula floods so

this is Thomas who's a returning student

late in life to the University of

Washington and he was working in a store

room a few weeks ago no a couple of

months ago and he noticed two file folds

with the name bretts on them and he'd

been watching the series that we've been

doing this winter so he started digging

in there and they were all the original

papers of Richard Foster Flint that must

have been given to Steven Porter who

worked for a long time at the University

of Washington and so these are the

personal copies the prints of the Papers

written by Brett's sent to his former

student

Flint well that's kind of fun that's

kind of cute some of these papers were

brought out to the field every summer

with Flint as he was attacking Brett's

ideas and mapping his own version of the

pl toine story in Eastern Washington for

dick Flint compliments Jay harand

bretts but there's passive aggressive

notes in the margin by Richard Foster

Flint as he's reading these Brett's

papers this one says this one isn't so

bad Flint is wondering to himself did

the Grand stream deepen into its

trench more rapidly than the cheni poo

or Telford crab Creek streams due to the

steeper gradient thus not them thus not

them thank you of

water more evidence this is salisbury's

1901 stuff that's not valid anyway Brett

has abandoned this

view it seems Brett says necessary to

assume prominent subglacial drainage

Flint very unlikely

and this last one this is one of Brett's

most impressive bodies of work right

after the Ambush meeting in Washington

DC bars of Channel scabin 1928 it's all

torn to shreds Brett Flint had this out

in the field but you know what he had

pasted on the inside cover Richard

Foster Flint pasted in the inside front

cover of this paper this type

account I'm going to read it to

you in reading his papers and in hearing

him present them orally I am deeply

impressed with the feeling and I find

that I am not alone in this that Dr

bretts is more concerned with proving

the hypothesis he has advanced than in

getting the true

explanation although he constantly

reiterates in his paper that he has

given due consideration to all the facts

that he has observed in the field

notwithstanding this

declaration I find that he dismisses

most of the facts that might have a

different interpretation from that which

he has put upon them merely with the

statement that no other interpretation

fits the case this naturally is far from

convincing there's another paragraph why

is this guy typing it out and pasting it

in the front cover of his field copy of

this paper bizarre and fast fting to

close

tonight there's a new discovery of

channels in the Spokane Airport area

that are not at the surface but they've

been

buried the channels were

cut sometime earlier than the Missoula

floods I wonder if they were cut by

earlier ice AG floods are they blue

channels regardless those ch channels

get filled with water if it's not red

water but it's Blue Water we're going to

fill completely these channels bury them

completely with red sediments coming in

later and that's the concept that if we

have channels that are completely masked

from the surface Foster in

Northern Washington might be that very

thing you see the uppermost Basalt

Cliffs but most of foster is

covered buried

concealed with this younger material if

we can vacuum up just for fun all those

Missoula flood sediments big and small

what would that bedrock look like and

how big would those coolies be from a

much earlier

time yes we have old

calrs yes we have Morango with the older

reversed paleomagnetic signatures from

Sky and Bruce bejor Dad we do

have these old stories and to be fair

bejn dad especially is commenting

regularly on these older floods that are

not getting the shine that they

typically get in a Missoula floods

book we finish with Joel showing us just

that little bit of data from the

Historia fan I'm guessing that there's

stage 12 marine isop stage 12 sand but

there's definitely only a third of the

sand of the St of fan that's of Missoula

flood's

age I think easily the most well-versed

and most imaginative and encouraging

Oldtimer who's still in the Ice Age

floods game is Vic Baker here he's

posing with Jay harand Brett shortly

before his death and Baker is still with

us and baker has worked in front of the

camera behind the camera in front of the

scenes behind the scenes with papers to

encourage all sorts of crazy angles and

we got a chance to visit with Vic to

explore some of those ideas so if

there's more people like Vic encouraging

a new generation of people to study this

stuff we can move forward with new

discoveries and possibly confirm some of

the original work of Jay harand bretts

so long ago if you're unfamiliar there's

my website and how to get to these

papers you click on either the word

bretts or the word floods

and there are dozens and dozens and

dozens of papers field notes Google

Earth files to have yourself a grand old

time going through this work last night

was what happened to the Spokane ice

sheet tonight was Brett's Spokane flood

in the Missoula

floods and the third and final

installment of this little series

tomorrow night was Moses carved

by subglacial floods

thanks for coming tonight

everybody I appreciate you all very

much thank you
