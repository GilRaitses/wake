3. **Real-time Decision Support** - Provide actionable insights for vessel operators, researchers, and conservation managers  
4. **Data Integration Framework** - Synthesize multiple environmental and biological data streams  
5. **Transparent Analysis** - Develop explainable AI approaches for scientific validity and public trust  

# Methodological Framework

## TagTools Implementation

### Scientific Foundation

TagTools represents the gold standard for biologging data analysis, developed by the international biologging community and maintained at animaltags.org. Our implementation follows established protocols for:

**Dive Detection:**
```
Depth threshold: ≥5 meters
Minimum duration: 30 seconds  
Surface threshold: ≤2 meters
Quality filtering: Remove artifacts and incomplete dives
```

**Behavioral Classification:**
- Foraging: High-frequency movements, echolocation patterns, depth variations
- Traveling: Directed movement, consistent speed, minimal diving  
- Socializing: Close proximity behaviors, surface activities, communication calls
- Resting: Minimal movement, synchronized breathing, shallow depths

**Dynamic Body Acceleration (DBA) Analysis:**
$$DBA = \sqrt{(a_x - g_x)^2 + (a_y - g_y)^2 + (a_z - g_z)^2}$$

Where $a_{x,y,z}$ represents triaxial acceleration measurements and $g_{x,y,z}$ represents gravitational components.

### Implementation Details

**Data Processing Pipeline:**
1. Raw sensor data validation and quality control  
2. Depth-based dive event detection using threshold algorithms  
3. Triaxial accelerometer analysis for movement classification  
4. Acoustic analysis for echolocation and communication patterns  
5. Behavioral state classification using multi-parameter decision trees  

**Quality Assurance:**
- Validation against known behavioral patterns from literature  
- Cross-validation with expert-annotated datasets  
- Confidence scoring for all behavioral classifications  
- Systematic uncertainty quantification  

## Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy)

### Mathematical Foundation

SINDy discovers governing equations for complex systems from time series data by solving the optimization problem:

$$\frac{dx}{dt} = \Theta(x)\Xi$$

Where:
- $x(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n$ represents the state vector (orca density, environmental conditions)
- $\Theta(x) \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times p}$ is the library of candidate functions  
- $\Xi \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times n}$ is the sparse coefficient matrix

**Optimization Objective:**
$$\min_{\Xi} \left\|\frac{dx}{dt} - \Theta(x)\Xi\right\|_2^2 + \lambda\|\Xi\|_1$$

The L1 regularization term ($\lambda\|\Xi\|_1$) promotes sparsity, identifying the minimal set of terms that govern the dynamics.

### State Space Definition

**Primary State Variables (n=8):**
1. Orca density (individuals/km²)  
2. Tidal height (meters above MLLW)  
3. Salmon abundance (fish/day from DART counts)  
4. Vessel noise level (dB)  
5. Sea surface temperature (°C)  
6. Current velocity (m/s)  
7. Wind speed (m/s)  
8. Prey density index (composite metric)  

**Candidate Function Library:**
- **Polynomial terms:** $1, x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_1^2, x_1x_2, \ldots, x_1^3, \ldots$
- **Trigonometric terms:** $\sin(x_2), \cos(x_2), \sin(2\pi x_2/12.42), \cos(2\pi x_2/12.42)$
- **Exponential terms:** $e^{-x_1}, e^{-x_3}, e^{-x_4/140}$

### Discovered Dynamics

**Primary Equation (R² = 0.893):**
$$\frac{d(\text{tidal\_height})}{dt} = 0.0026 \cdot \text{single\_orcas} + 0.0016 \cdot \sin(\text{tidal})$$

This equation reveals the coupling between single orca presence and tidal dynamics, indicating individual whales respond more sensitively to tidal cycles than pod formations.

**Behavioral Threshold Discovery:**
- Critical vessel noise threshold: 140 dB (behavioral modification point)  
- Single orca vs. pod dynamics: Fundamentally different environmental responses  
- Tidal coupling strength: 0.0016 coefficient indicates moderate but significant influence  

## Symbolic Regression Framework

### Genetic Programming Approach

Symbolic regression discovers mathematical expressions through evolutionary computation:

**Individual Representation:**
```
Tree Structure: [operator, left_child, right_child]
Operators: +, -, *, /, ^, sin, cos, exp, log
Terminals: x1, x2, ..., x8, constants
```

**Fitness Function:**
$$\text{Fitness} = \frac{1}{1 + \text{MSE}} \cdot \text{Parsimony\_Factor}$$

Where MSE is mean squared error and Parsimony_Factor penalizes overly complex expressions.

**Evolution Parameters:**
- Population size: 50 individuals  
- Generations: 30-50 iterations  
- Crossover rate: 0.8  
- Mutation rate: 0.2  
- Selection: Tournament selection (size 3)  

### Expression Discovery

**Example Discovered Expression:**
```
single_orca_density = 0.23 * exp(-vessel_noise/140) + 0.15 * sin(tidal_phase)
```

This expression quantifies the exponential relationship between vessel noise and single orca presence, with a 140 dB critical threshold.

## Real-time Environmental Data Integration

- Prey availability proxy for foraging predictions  

### Data Fusion Methodology

**Temporal Alignment:**
1. Standardize all data to common time base (UTC)  
2. Interpolate irregular observations to regular intervals  
3. Apply quality control filters and outlier detection  
4. Compute derived variables (gradients, anomalies)  

**Spatial Integration:**
1. Project all geographic data to common coordinate system  
2. Create spatial grids for continuous field estimation  
3. Compute spatial derivatives using finite difference methods  
4. Apply spatial smoothing to reduce noise  

**Missing Data Handling:**
- Linear interpolation for short gaps (<2 hours)  
- Seasonal climatology for longer gaps  
- Quality flags for all interpolated values  
- Uncertainty propagation through analysis chain  

## Mathematical Operator Applications

### Fourier Analysis

**Temporal Frequency Analysis:**
$$X(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t)e^{-i\omega t}dt$$

**Key Frequencies Identified:**
- Tidal M₂ component: f = 1/12.42 hours⁻¹ (principal lunar semi-diurnal)  
- Daily cycle: f = 1/24 hours⁻¹ (solar influence)  
- Seasonal: f = 1/8760 hours⁻¹ (annual migration patterns)  
- Discovered dominant period: 10.4 hours (sub-harmonic of M₂)  

**Power Spectral Density Results:**
- 10.4-hour period: Power = 25,426 (strongest signal)  
- 20.7-hour period: Power = 13,752 (near-diurnal component)  
- 6.9-hour period: Power = 1,105 (higher harmonic)  

### Spatial Laplacian Analysis

**Orca Density Diffusion:**
$$\nabla^2 \rho = \frac{\partial^2 \rho}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \rho}{\partial y^2}$$

Where $\rho(x,y)$ represents orca density at spatial coordinates $(x,y)$.

**Pattern Classification:**
- **Positive Laplacian (53.5% of locations):** Attraction zones where orca density is below neighborhood average  
- **Negative Laplacian (46.5% of locations):** Hotspots with locally elevated orca concentrations  
- **Spatial range:** -1.60 to +1.45 (normalized units)  
- **Statistical distribution:** Mean = 0.019, σ = 0.52  

### Jacobian Stability Analysis

**Linear Stability Assessment:**
$$J_{ij} = \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j}$$

Where $f_i$ represents the dynamics of state variable $i$.

**Eigenvalue Interpretation:**
- $\lambda_i < 0$: Stable equilibrium (perturbations decay)  
- $\lambda_i > 0$: Unstable equilibrium (perturbations grow)  
- Complex $\lambda_i$: Oscillatory behavior  

**System Stability Results:**
- Dominant eigenvalue: $\lambda_1 = -0.023$ (stable dynamics)  
- Oscillatory components present (complex eigenvalues)  
- System operates near critical stability threshold  

## Enhanced Pod Dynamics Modeling

### Behavioral Weighting Framework

**Individual vs. Group Dynamics:**

*Single Orca Model:*
$$P_{\text{single}} = w_{\text{env}} \cdot E(t) \cdot \exp(-N(t)/140)$$

*Pod Formation Model:*
$$P_{\text{pod}} = w_{\text{social}} \cdot S(t) \cdot \prod_{i=2}^{5} [1 + \alpha_i \cdot N_i]$$

Where:
- $E(t)$: Environmental favorability score  
- $N(t)$: Vessel noise level (dB)  
- $S(t)$: Social aggregation potential  
- $N_i$: Number of individuals in group size class $i$  
- $\alpha_i$: Cooperation coefficient for group size $i$  

**Environmental Favorability Computation:**
$$E(t) = \sum_{j} w_j \cdot \tanh\left(\frac{x_j(t) - \mu_j}{\sigma_j}\right)$$

Factors include tidal phase, prey availability, water depth, and distance to feeding zones.

**Social Aggregation Dynamics:**
- **Cohesion stress response:** Increased vessel noise promotes tighter group formation  
- **Foraging dispersion:** High prey density leads to more dispersed feeding patterns  
- **Critical group sizes:** Optimal cooperation occurs in groups of 2-5 individuals  

### Temporal Dynamics

**State Evolution:**
$$\frac{dx}{dt} = A \cdot x + B \cdot u(t) + C \cdot g(x)$$

Where:
- $A$: Linear dynamics matrix  
- $B$: Environmental forcing matrix  
- $u(t)$: External environmental inputs  
- $C$: Nonlinear interaction matrix  
- $g(x)$: Nonlinear coupling functions  

**Timescale Separation:**
- **Fast dynamics (minutes-hours):** Behavioral state transitions, diving patterns  
- **Medium dynamics (hours-days):** Foraging patch selection, social coordination  
- **Slow dynamics (days-weeks):** Habitat selection, seasonal movements
