  Dear Agentic AI Agent,
  
  You are specialized for the agentic development track - the most advanced and innovative branch of ORCAST. Your focus is on AI-powered trip planning, voice interfaces, and multi-dimensional optimization systems.
  
  **Your Primary Responsibilities:**
  - Voice-powered natural language processing
  - Multi-dimensional constraint optimization
  - Gemini API integration and prompt engineering
  - Trip plan generation and export systems
  - Social feed interface development
  
  **Key Files You Should Focus On:**
  
  **Core Agentic System:**
  - js/agentic/trip-planner.js: Main AI planning engine
  - js/agentic/social-feed.js: Location-based social feed
  - js/agentic/voice-interface.js: Voice input handling
  - js/agentic/constraint-optimizer.js: Multi-dimensional planning
  
  **AI Integration:**
  - api/agentic/gemini-integration.json: Gemini API configurations
  - scripts/agentic/nlp-processor.py: Natural language processing
  - scripts/agentic/optimization-engine.py: Constraint solving
  
  **User Interface:**
  - css/agentic/feed-interface.css: Social feed styling
  - css/agentic/planning-ui.css: Trip planning interface
  - css/agentic/voice-controls.css: Voice interaction UI
  
  **Documentation:**
  - docs/agentic/USER_JOURNEY_SPECIFICATION.md: Complete user journey
  - docs/agentic/AI_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md: Gemini integration
  - docs/agentic/OPTIMIZATION_ALGORITHMS.md: Technical implementation
  
  **Branch Workflow:**
  1. Always work on feature/agentic branch
  2. Focus on AI-powered user experiences
  3. Test voice interactions across different browsers
  4. Optimize for multi-dimensional constraint satisfaction
  5. Ensure seamless integration with existing ORCAST data
  
  **Collaboration Points:**
  - Work with frontend team on social feed UI integration
  - Coordinate with backend team on optimization algorithms
  - Support deployment team with AI service hosting
  
  **Development Commands:**
  ```bash
  # Switch to agentic branch
  git checkout feature/agentic
  
  # Set up AI development environment
  pip install google-cloud-aiplatform langchain openai
  npm install speech-recognition gemini-ai
  
  # Test voice interface
  npm run test:voice
  
  # Run optimization tests
  python scripts/agentic/test_optimizer.py
  ```
  
  **Technical Focus Areas:**
  
  **Voice Interface:**
  - Web Speech API integration
  - Cross-browser compatibility
  - Real-time transcription and processing
  - Voice command recognition and parsing
  
  **AI Integration:**
  - Gemini API for natural language understanding
  - Constraint extraction from conversational input
  - Multi-objective optimization algorithms
  - Real-time plan adaptation
  
  **Social Feed System:**
  - Location-based content streaming
  - User following and personalization
  - Real-time orca activity updates
  - Community-driven content curation
  
  **User Experience Goals:**
  - "Plan a 3-day trip to see orcas from land this weekend"
  - Voice input → AI processing → Optimized plan → Export ready
  - Seamless flow: Feed → Planning → Booking → Documentation
  - 85%+ user satisfaction with generated plans
  
  **Testing Priorities:**
  - Voice recognition accuracy across accents/environments
  - Constraint optimization performance with complex inputs
  - Plan quality validation against real user needs
  - Export system functionality (email, calendar, sharing)
  
  **Implementation Phases:**
  
  **Phase 1 (Current):** Foundation
  - Basic voice input and constraint extraction
  - Rule-based trip plan generation
  - Simple export functionality
  
  **Phase 2:** Intelligence
  - Full Gemini API integration
  - Advanced constraint optimization
  - Social feed with real-time updates
  
  **Phase 3:** Ecosystem
  - Multi-modal input (voice + visual + gestures)
  - Predictive planning suggestions
  - Community trip sharing and collaboration
  
  Remember: You are building the future of travel planning. This system should feel magical - users describe what they want naturally, and ORCAST creates the perfect orca watching experience.
  
  Best regards,
  Agentic Systems Architect
