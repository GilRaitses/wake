  Based on project manager feedback and best practices for small team development:
  
  **Problem with 5 branches:**
  - Too much overhead for project this size
  - UI/UX overlap significantly  
  - API development often pairs with backend work
  - Documentation can be handled by any developer
  
  **NEW CONSOLIDATED STRATEGY - 3 BRANCHES:**
  
  ## Branch 1: `feature/frontend` 
  **Combined UI/UX and Map Visualization**
  
  **Responsibilities:**
  - HTML structure and CSS styling
  - Google Maps integration and visualization
  - User experience and interface design
  - Frontend JavaScript components
  - Mobile responsiveness and accessibility
  
  **Key Files:**
  - `index.html`: Main application structure
  - `css/`: All stylesheets (base, sidebar, tabs, inspection)
  - `js/map-component.js`: Google Maps integration
  - `js/ui-controller.js`: UI state management (renamed from "controller")
  - `js/data-loader.js`: Frontend data handling
  - `manifest.json`: PWA configuration
  
  **Team Members:** Frontend developers, UI/UX designers, map specialists
  
  ## Branch 2: `feature/backend`
  **Combined Backend Integration and API Development**
  
  **Responsibilities:**
  - Data processing and machine learning
  - API endpoint development and optimization
  - Database management and queries
  - Real-time data collection
  - Performance optimization
  
  **Key Files:**
  - `scripts/`: All Python processing scripts
  - `api/`: API specifications and mock data
  - `js/api-tester.js`: API testing interface
  - `data/`: Data files and schemas
  - `env.template` and `config.js.template`: Configuration
  
  **Team Members:** Backend developers, data scientists, API specialists
  
  ## Branch 3: `feature/deployment`
  **DevOps, Documentation, and Deployment**
  
  **Responsibilities:**
  - Deployment scripts and CI/CD
  - Documentation maintenance
  - Environment configuration
  - Testing and quality assurance
  - Project coordination
  
  **Key Files:**
  - `deploy/`: Deployment scripts
  - `docs/`: All documentation
  - `.github/workflows/`: CI/CD workflows
  - `firebase.json`: Hosting configuration
  - `README.md`: Project overview
  
  **Team Members:** DevOps engineers, technical writers, project leads
  
  ## Benefits of 3-Branch Strategy:
  
  1. **Clearer Ownership:** Less overlap between teams
  2. **Faster Development:** Fewer merge conflicts
  3. **Easier Coordination:** Only 3 teams to sync instead of 5
  4. **Natural Groupings:** Related work stays together
  5. **Scalable:** Can split branches later if team grows
  
  ## Branch Workflow:
  ```bash
  # Frontend team
  git checkout feature/frontend
  
  # Backend team  
  git checkout feature/backend
  
  # Deployment team
  git checkout feature/deployment
  
  # Integration
  git checkout develop  # All features merge here first
  git checkout main     # Production releases
  ```
  
  ## Collaboration Points:
  - **Frontend ↔ Backend:** API contracts and data formats
  - **Backend ↔ Deployment:** Environment setup and scaling
  - **Frontend ↔ Deployment:** Build processes and hosting
  
  This structure aligns with how most small-to-medium development teams naturally organize work.
